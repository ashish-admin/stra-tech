# Database Data Loss Investigation Report
**LokDarpan Political Intelligence Platform**

**Investigation Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Investigator:** Database Migration Specialist  
**Issue:** Missing 6 months of enriched political intelligence data

---

## Executive Summary

üö® **CRITICAL DATA LOSS CONFIRMED**: The LokDarpan database has lost significant amounts of previously generated political intelligence data. Multiple critical tables are empty or contain minimal data, indicating a significant data loss event.

## Database Analysis Results

### Current Data State

Based on database analysis performed on August 29, 2025:

**Available Tables (20 total):**
- ai_model_execution, alembic_version, alert, alerts, author, authors, budget_tracker
- election, embedding_store, epaper, geopolitical_report, polling_station
- post, posts, result_ps, result_ward_agg, user, ward_demographics, ward_features, ward_profile

### Critical Data Loss Indicators

#### üö® Empty Critical Tables
- **epaper: 0 rows** (Should contain news article sources)
- **ward_profile: 0 rows** (Should contain ward intelligence profiles)  
- **ward_demographics: 0 rows** (Should contain demographic enrichment data)
- **alert: 0 rows** (Should contain political intelligence alerts)
- **embedding_store: 0 rows** (Should contain vector embeddings for AI analysis)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minimal Data Tables
- **post: 918 rows** (Basic posts exist but may lack enrichment)
- **author: 1 row** (Severely limited author data)
- **user: 1 row** (Only basic user setup)

#### ‚ùå Transaction Error Tables
- **geopolitical_report: Transaction Error** (Cannot analyze)
- **ai_model_execution: Transaction Error** (Cannot analyze)
- **budget_tracker: Transaction Error** (Cannot analyze)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Most Likely Causes

1. **Recent Migration Issue**: Database migration may have included destructive operations that truncated or dropped data tables
2. **Data Archival/Cleanup**: Automated cleanup process may have removed "old" data
3. **Schema Reset**: Recent deployment or development reset may have cleared enriched data
4. **Backup Restoration**: System may have been restored from an early backup point

### Evidence Supporting Data Loss

- **Zero rows in enrichment tables**: Ward profiles, demographics, and embeddings are completely empty
- **Missing epaper data**: No news source data despite system being designed for news ingestion
- **Transaction errors**: Database appears to be in an inconsistent state
- **Missing AI model executions**: No record of previous AI processing runs

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact
- **Complete loss of 6 months of political intelligence data**
- **All ward-level enrichments missing** (demographics, profiles, strategic analysis)
- **No historical sentiment analysis or trend data**
- **Complete loss of AI-generated insights and embeddings**
- **Alert system non-functional due to empty alert table**

### Technical Impact
- **Frontend dashboard shows minimal data**
- **AI features lack training/historical data**
- **Strategic analysis capabilities severely limited**
- **Political trend analysis impossible without historical data**

## Recovery Options Analysis

### Available Recovery Resources

#### ‚úÖ Data Seeding Scripts (Available)
- `C:\Users\amukt\Projects\LokDarpan\backend\scripts\reseed_demo_data.py`
- `C:\Users\amukt\Projects\LokDarpan\backend\scripts\seed_minimal_ward.py`  
- `C:\Users\amukt\Projects\LokDarpan\backend\scripts\seed_comprehensive_political_data.py`

#### ‚úÖ Epaper Data Files (Available)
- **Inbox Directory**: `C:\Users\amukt\Projects\LokDarpan\backend\data\epaper\inbox`
- **Processed Directory**: `C:\Users\amukt\Projects\LokDarpan\backend\data\epaper\processed`
- Contains processed articles from previous ingestion runs

#### ‚ùå Database Backups
- No evidence of recent database backup files
- Need to investigate if automated backups exist

## Step-by-Step Recovery Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization (1-2 hours)
```bash
# 1. Stop all data ingestion processes
pkill -f "celery.*worker"
pkill -f "celery.*beat"

# 2. Navigate to backend directory
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR call venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows

# 3. Check current migration state
export FLASK_APP=app:create_app
flask db current
flask db upgrade  # Apply any pending migrations
```

### Phase 2: Data Recovery (2-4 hours)
```bash
# 4. Restore basic ward and demographic data
python scripts/seed_comprehensive_political_data.py

# 5. Re-ingest epaper data from processed files
cd data/epaper/processed
for file in *.jsonl; do
    celery -A celery_worker.celery call app.tasks.ingest_epaper_jsonl --args="[\"data/epaper/processed/$file\", true]"
done

# 6. Regenerate embeddings and AI analysis
celery -A celery_worker.celery call app.tasks.generate_embeddings
celery -A celery_worker.celery call app.tasks.generate_summaries
```

### Phase 3: Data Enrichment (4-8 hours)
```bash
# 7. Run ward profile enrichment
python scripts/enrich_ward_data_with_real_intel.py

# 8. Generate AI model executions and reports
celery -A celery_worker.celery call app.tasks.run_political_analysis

# 9. Populate alert system with current intelligence
python scripts/generate_political_alerts.py
```

### Phase 4: Verification (1 hour)
```bash
# 10. Run database analysis again to verify recovery
python database_analysis.py

# 11. Test frontend functionality
# Navigate to http://localhost:5173
# Verify ward selection, charts, and data display

# 12. Run API endpoint tests
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/trends?ward=All&days=30
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/pulse/Jubilee%20Hills
```

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Implement Database Backups**: Set up automated daily backups
2. **Add Data Validation**: Check data counts before major operations
3. **Migration Safety**: Add rollback procedures for all schema changes
4. **Monitoring Alerts**: Set up alerts for dramatic data count drops

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Backup Strategy**: Implement 3-2-1 backup rule
2. **Data Retention Policy**: Clear policies on what data to archive vs. delete  
3. **Migration Testing**: Test all migrations on production-like data
4. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of critical table row counts

## Expected Recovery Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Stabilization)**: 1-2 hours
- **Phase 2 (Data Recovery)**: 2-4 hours  
- **Phase 3 (Enrichment)**: 4-8 hours
- **Phase 4 (Verification)**: 1 hour

**Total Recovery Time**: 8-15 hours

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Some historical data may be permanently lost** if no backups exist
- **AI model training data may need to be rebuilt** from scratch
- **Custom enrichments may need manual recreation**

### Medium Risk Items  
- **Performance impact** during bulk data restoration
- **Potential for incomplete data recovery** if scripts have issues

### Low Risk Items
- **Basic system functionality** should be restored quickly
- **Core political data structures** are well-documented and reproducible

---

## Immediate Action Required

**PRIORITY 1**: Execute Phase 1 (Stabilization) immediately to prevent further data loss
**PRIORITY 2**: Contact system administrator to check for any available backup files
**PRIORITY 3**: Begin Phase 2 (Data Recovery) using available seeding scripts

## Contact Information
- **Technical Issues**: Check migration logs in `backend/migrations/versions/`
- **Data Recovery**: Use scripts in `backend/scripts/`
- **System Status**: Monitor `backend/logs/` for error patterns
