2. **Real-time Data Pipeline**: Establish continuous epaper ingestion with deduplication
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Deploy leader mention tracking and issue cluster analysis
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement query performance monitoring and alerting

### Long-term Strategic Goals (1-3 months)
1. **AI Intelligence Expansion**: Full multi-model AI integration with Gemini and Perplexity
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Electoral prediction models based on sentiment and engagement trends
3. **Scalability Optimization**: Support for 1-5K AI reports/month with <200ms response times
4. **Data Governance**: Comprehensive backup, disaster recovery, and retention policies

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Optimization (Week 1)
- Create performance indexes for ward-centric queries
- Implement data validation constraints and foreign key relationships
- Establish automated backup procedures with validation

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Data Seeding (Week 1-2)
- Generate realistic political data for all 150 GHMC wards
- Create comprehensive epaper archive with proper SHA256 deduplication
- Establish AI-generated strategic summaries and alerts for each ward

### Phase 3: Performance Validation (Week 2)
- Validate query performance targets (<100ms for ward queries)
- Implement monitoring and alerting for performance regression
- Conduct load testing with production-like data volumes

### Phase 4: AI Infrastructure Preparation (Week 2-3)
- Prepare pgvector extension for embeddings storage
- Implement leader tracking and political sentiment analysis
- Establish real-time data ingestion pipeline

## Quality Gates & Success Metrics

### Data Completeness Targets
- ✅ Ward Coverage: 100% (150/150 wards)
- ✅ Data Volume: >50 posts per ward minimum
- ✅ Temporal Coverage: 30-day rolling window with daily updates
- ✅ Quality Score: >95% for all completeness metrics

### Performance Targets
- ✅ Ward Queries: <100ms for 95th percentile
- ✅ Aggregation Queries: <150ms for complex analytics
- ✅ Time-series Queries: <200ms for trend analysis
- ✅ AI Vector Search: <200ms for similarity queries

### Data Integrity Standards
