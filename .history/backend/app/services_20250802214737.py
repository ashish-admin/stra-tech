    You are a sophisticated political analyst. Analyze the dominant emotion for each text entry in the following list.
    Classify each text into one of the following exact categories:
    - Hope: Expressing optimism about the future.
    - Anger: Expressing frustration or outrage, often at a specific entity.
    - Joy: Expressing happiness or celebration.
    - Anxiety: Expressing worry or unease about the future or specific issues.
    - Sadness: Expressing disappointment or sorrow.
    - Disgust: Expressing strong disapproval or revulsion.
    - Apathy: Expressing a lack of interest, indifference, or neutral sentiment.
