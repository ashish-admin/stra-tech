## 🎯 Optimization Recommendations (Post-Launch)

### Database Optimizations
```sql
-- 1. Add composite indexes for ward+date queries (33% current usage)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_post_city_created_at 
ON post(city, created_at) WHERE city IS NOT NULL;

-- 2. Implement materialized views for dashboard aggregations  
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ward_daily_summary AS
SELECT city, DATE(created_at) as date, 
       COUNT(*) as posts, COUNT(DISTINCT party) as parties
FROM post GROUP BY city, DATE(created_at);

-- 3. Add full-text search for content analysis
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_post_content_fts 
ON post USING gin(to_tsvector('english', content));
```

### Performance Enhancements
```javascript
// 1. Implement service worker for offline capability
// 2. Add lazy loading for non-critical chart components
// 3. Implement virtual scrolling for large data sets
// 4. Add prefetching for anticipated ward selections
```

### Advanced AI Features
```python
# 1. Implement confidence scoring for AI recommendations
# 2. Add multi-language support for regional content
# 3. Implement trend prediction algorithms  
# 4. Add anomaly detection for unusual patterns
```
