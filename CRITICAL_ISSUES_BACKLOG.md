# LokDarpan Critical Issues Backlog
**Test Architect: Quinn ðŸ§ª**  
**Date**: August 29, 2025  
**Status**: URGENT ACTION REQUIRED

## ðŸš¨ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Critical Finding**: The $200K+ Phase 3-5 investment is **NOT accessible to campaign teams** despite being implemented in the backend. The frontend UI lacks integration for advanced political intelligence features.

**Business Impact**: Campaign teams cannot access:
- Political Strategist analysis
- Strategic workbench capabilities  
- AI-powered briefings
- Advanced scenario simulation
- Real-time intelligence streaming

- **Assignee**: Full-stack Developer
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Real-time political intelligence streaming
  - [ ] Connection recovery on network issues
  - [ ] Live updates in dashboard components
  - [ ] Progress indicators for long-running analysis

### ðŸŸ¢ P2 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Week 3) - Polish & Documentation

#### 5. Phase 4 Visualization Completion
- **Impact**: LOW - Advanced features missing
- **Description**: Enhanced charts and heatmaps not fully integrated
- **Current State**: Components exist but not connected to data sources

## ðŸš¨ BUSINESS RISK ASSESSMENT

**High Risk**: Without immediate action, campaign teams cannot access advanced political intelligence capabilities during critical campaign periods.

**Financial Risk**: $200K+ development investment remains inaccessible, representing 0% ROI.

**Competitive Risk**: Campaign teams operating with basic dashboard while competitors may have access to advanced political intelligence.

**Recommendation**: Execute P0 issues immediately (Week 1) to restore business value and campaign team access to investment.
