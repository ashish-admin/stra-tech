## üö® **CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **Issue 1: Gemini API Integration Failure** ‚≠ê **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
**Problem**: Gemini API quota exhausted - "quota_limit_value: 0"
```
429 Quota exceeded for quota metric 'Generate Content API requests per minute'
```
**Location**: `backend/strategist/reasoner/ultra_think.py:79`
**Impact**: BLOCKS all AI-powered political analysis
**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Configure Google Cloud Project billing and quotas
- [ ] Set appropriate request limits for development/production
- [ ] Test API connectivity with successful generation requests
- [ ] Implement proper rate limiting and error handling
- [ ] Create fallback responses for quota exhaustion scenarios

### **Issue 2: Redis Infrastructure Missing** ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**  
**Problem**: Redis server not running - "Connection refused localhost:6379"
**Impact**: BLOCKS caching, session management, background tasks
**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Install Redis server (local development + production setup)
- [ ] Configure Redis for LokDarpan requirements  
- [ ] Test connectivity from Python application
- [ ] Setup Redis persistence and backup strategies
- [ ] Document Redis deployment procedures

### **Issue 3: API Endpoint Integration Failures** ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Problem**: `/api/v1/strategist/<ward>` returns 500 Internal Server Error
**Location**: `backend/app/strategist_api.py` and `backend/app/services/strategist_integration.py`
**Impact**: BLOCKS frontend integration and user-facing functionality
**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Debug strategist_integration.py execution failures
- [ ] Fix async/sync integration issues with Flask
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error logging and handling
- [ ] Test end-to-end API request/response flow
- [ ] Validate JSON response format matches frontend expectations

### **Issue 4: System Verification Failures** ‚≠ê **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Problem**: `verify_strategist.py` fails with encoding errors and reports "AI Powered: False"
**Impact**: Cannot validate system operational status
**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Fix Unicode encoding issues in verification script
- [ ] Repair system health check logic
- [ ] Create reliable status validation procedures
- [ ] Implement automated health monitoring
