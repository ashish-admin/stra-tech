# Integration Audit Checklist

**Purpose**: Systematic verification of component-to-UI integration status to prevent "floating" components and ensure all built features are user-accessible.

**Addresses**: Core brainstorming insight - "Features built as components/endpoints but not UI-wired"

```

### **Phase 3: User Workflow Validation (1 minute)**

#### **Critical User Paths Working**
```
Campaign Manager Workflow:
- [ ] Login ‚Üí Dashboard loads successfully
- [ ] Select ward ‚Üí Data updates across all components

## üö® **Integration Gap Detection**

### **Common Integration Issues to Check**

#### **Backend Built, Frontend Missing**
```
Signs of Backend-Only Components:
‚ùå API endpoint responds but no UI element calls it
‚ùå Celery task processes but results never displayed
‚ùå Database table populated but no UI shows the data
‚ùå New feature works in API testing but invisible to users

Action: Create frontend components and integrate API calls
```

#### **Frontend Built, Backend Missing**  
```
Signs of Frontend-Only Components:
‚ùå UI component renders but shows placeholder data
‚ùå Button/form exists but doesn't trigger backend action
‚ùå Chart component ready but no data endpoint
‚ùå User interface complete but functionality missing

Action: Implement backend endpoints and wire to frontend
```

#### **Components Built, Integration Missing**
```
Signs of Integration Gaps:
‚ùå Both frontend and backend exist but don't communicate
‚ùå API calls fail with 404/500 errors
‚ùå Data returned but not displayed correctly
‚ùå User actions don't trigger expected backend processes

Action: Fix API routing, error handling, and data flow
```

### **Rapid Gap Identification Commands**

#### **Backend Verification**
```bash
# Test all strategic endpoints
for endpoint in "/api/v1/strategist/All" "/api/v1/trends" "/api/v1/pulse/All"; do
    curl -s "http://localhost:5000${endpoint}" > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ ${endpoint}" || echo "‚ùå ${endpoint}"
done

# Check recent code additions for new endpoints
grep -r "@app.route\|@bp.route" backend/app/ --include="*.py" | tail -5
```

#### **Frontend Verification**
```bash
# Check for recent component additions
find frontend/src/components -name "*.jsx" -mtime -7 | head -5

# Verify build includes all new components
cd frontend && npm run build 2>&1 | grep -E "(error|Error|failed)" || echo "‚úÖ Build successful"
```

#### **Integration Verification**
```bash
# Check for API calls in frontend code
grep -r "fetch\|axios\|api\." frontend/src --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" | grep -v node_modules | tail -5

# Verify API error handling
grep -r "catch\|error" frontend/src/components --include="*.jsx" | wc -l | sed 's/^/Error handlers: /'
```

## üîß **Integration with Daily Workflow**

### **Morning Integration Check** (3 minutes total)
1. **Quick Inventory** (1 min): List components built yesterday
2. **Gap Detection** (1 min): Run verification commands
3. **Action Planning** (1 min): Prioritize any gaps discovered

### **During Development**
- Check integration status before marking any component "complete"
- Test component integration immediately after building
- Update integration audit as new components are created

### **Evening Review**
- Validate all day's work is user-accessible
- Document any integration gaps for tomorrow
- Plan integration work for next day's priorities

This checklist ensures the rapid development velocity doesn't create "integration debt" that reduces the platform's competitive advantage for campaign teams.
