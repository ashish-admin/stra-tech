# Daily Project State Awareness System

**Purpose**: Systematic daily routine for maintaining "integration status awareness" during rapid development phases.

**Problem Solved**: As identified in August 24, 2025 brainstorming session - *"Speed of development inversely correlates with state awareness"* and *"Real challenge is 'integration status awareness' not just task prioritization"*

---

## üéØ **System Overview**

This daily routine system addresses the core challenge for solo developers using Claude Code: maintaining comprehensive project state awareness while development velocity accelerates. 

**Key Insight**: Fast development with Claude Code creates systematic integration debt that requires dedicated management processes.

### **Core Components**

1. **üåÖ Smart Morning Command Sequence** (5 minutes)
2. **üìã Daily Project Snapshot Template** (15 minutes daily)
3. **üîç Integration Audit Checklist** (3 minutes daily)

## üöÄ **Quick Start Guide**

### **Day 1: Setup**
```bash
# 1. Verify system is ready
cd /mnt/c/Users/amukt/Projects/LokDarpan
bash scripts/morning-check.sh

# 2. Create your first daily snapshot
cp docs/daily-routine/daily-snapshot-template.md docs/daily-routine/daily-snapshots/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-lokdarpan-snapshot.md

# 3. Fill in morning state assessment from command sequence output
```

### **Day 2+: Daily Routine**
```bash
# Morning (5 minutes total):
bash scripts/morning-check.sh                    # System state verification
# Copy template for today's snapshot
# Fill in priorities based on morning check results

# Throughout day: Update snapshot with progress
# Evening (5 minutes): Complete success metrics and tomorrow's prep
```

bash scripts/morning-check.sh
```

**What It Checks**:
- ‚úÖ Backend API health and response times
- ‚úÖ Frontend development server status  
- ‚úÖ Database connectivity and content
- ‚úÖ Strategic AI and SSE streaming functionality
- ‚úÖ Critical API endpoint availability
- ‚úÖ Build health and component accessibility
- ‚úÖ Recent development activity and git status
- ‚úÖ System resources and performance metrics

**Output**: Structured report with ‚úÖ/‚ùå status indicators for all critical systems

### **2. Daily Project Snapshot (15 minutes daily)**

**Purpose**: Structured project state capture with actionable intelligence

**Usage**:
```bash
# Morning (10 minutes):
cp docs/daily-routine/daily-snapshot-template.md docs/daily-routine/daily-snapshots/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-lokdarpan-snapshot.md
# Fill in system state from morning check
# Set top 3 priorities with specific Claude Code commands

# Evening (5 minutes):
# Update success metrics and tomorrow's preparation
```

**Key Sections**:
- **Morning State Assessment**: System health and integration status
- **Daily Priorities**: Top 3 tasks with ready-to-use Claude Code commands
- **Resource Awareness**: Budget, performance, and dependency tracking
- **Gap Analysis**: Integration audit results and action items
- **Execution Plan**: Time-blocked development schedule
- **Success Metrics**: Completion criteria and evening review

### **3. Integration Audit Checklist (3 minutes daily)**

**Purpose**: Systematic verification preventing "components built but not UI-wired" gaps

**Usage**: Follow checklist in `integration-audit-checklist.md` during morning routine

**What It Audits**:
- üì¶ Backend components ‚Üí Frontend integration status
- üé® Frontend components ‚Üí Data source connectivity  
- üîå API endpoints ‚Üí UI element utilization
- üë§ User workflows ‚Üí End-to-end functionality
- üîç Integration gaps ‚Üí Prioritized action items

**Outcome**: Zero "floating" components, all built features user-accessible

---

## üìä **Success Metrics & Benefits**

### **Measured Outcomes**
- **‚úÖ Zero unexpected integration failures**: All built features accessible to users
- **‚úÖ Consistent development velocity**: No slowdown from state confusion
- **‚úÖ Reduced cognitive load**: Structured approach to daily planning
- **‚úÖ Early issue detection**: Problems caught before they become blockers
- **‚úÖ Strategic focus**: Clear priorities derived from systematic assessment

### **Time Investment vs Return**
```
Daily Investment: 20 minutes total
- Morning routine: 5 minutes (command sequence)
- Snapshot creation: 10 minutes (planning and state capture)
- Evening review: 5 minutes (completion and tomorrow prep)

Weekly Return: 2-4 hours saved
- No "rediscovery" time for project state
- No integration gap debugging
- No priority confusion or decision paralysis
- No unexpected component accessibility issues
```

### **Key Performance Indicators**
- **Integration Health Score**: >95% (components built = components accessible)
- **Daily Priority Completion**: >80% (clear focus drives execution)
- **System State Awareness**: 100% (always know current project status)
- **Development Momentum**: Maintained (no velocity loss from confusion)

## üîó **Claude Code Integration**

### **Smart Command Generation**
The daily snapshot template includes ready-to-use Claude Code commands:

```bash
# Examples from template:
/implement keyboard-navigation --persona-frontend --magic --validate
/improve performance --focus optimization --loop --iterations 2
/analyze integration-status --think --seq --persona-analyzer
/troubleshoot any-issues-discovered --persona-performance
```

### **Persona-Aware Recommendations**
- **Frontend work**: Automatically suggests `--persona-frontend --magic`
- **Backend optimization**: Recommends `--persona-backend --performance`
- **System analysis**: Uses `--persona-analyzer --seq --think`
- **Quality improvement**: Applies `--persona-refactorer --loop`

### **Context-Sensitive Flags**
- **Complex tasks**: Auto-includes `--think` or `--think-hard`
- **UI enhancements**: Suggests `--magic --c7` combination
- **Performance work**: Recommends `--validate --uc` for efficiency
- **Integration issues**: Uses `--seq` for systematic problem solving

Track patterns in your daily snapshots to identify:
- **Recurring integration gaps**: Systematic process improvements needed
- **Time estimation accuracy**: Better planning over time  
- **Development velocity trends**: Optimize for consistent productivity
- **Technical debt accumulation**: Proactive management strategies

### **Continuous Improvement**
- **Weekly reviews**: Analyze snapshot patterns for process optimization
- **Monthly retrospectives**: Assess system effectiveness and refinements
- **Quarterly evolution**: Adapt system for changing project complexity

### **Knowledge Base Building**
- Daily snapshots become searchable project history
- Integration patterns emerge from consistent audit practice
- Success metrics provide data-driven process optimization

## üö® **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Morning Check Script Fails**
```bash
# Fix permissions
chmod +x scripts/morning-check.sh

# Fix line endings (Windows)
sed -i 's/\r$//' scripts/morning-check.sh

# Check environment variables
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

### **Integration Gaps Not Detected**
- Verify audit checklist completeness for your specific components
- Add project-specific integration verification commands
- Include user workflow testing in daily routine

### **Daily Snapshots Becoming Routine**
- Vary the analysis depth based on project complexity
- Focus on different aspects (performance, quality, security) on different days
- Use insights section to capture learning and maintain engagement

### **Time Investment Too High**
- Start with just morning check script (5 minutes)
- Gradually add snapshot sections as value becomes clear
- Use template shortcuts and copy-paste for repeated elements
