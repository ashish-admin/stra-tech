## ‚öñÔ∏è RISK MANAGEMENT & CONTINGENCY

### **High-Risk Items & Mitigation**

**Risk 1: API Configuration Complexity**
- **Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Allocate extra time for Google Cloud setup, have backup local AI option ready
- **Contingency**: Focus on Redis and system validation if API setup blocked

**Risk 2: Redis Infrastructure Issues**  
- **Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Use Docker container for consistent Redis setup
- **Contingency**: Implement in-memory caching fallback for development

**Risk 3: Frontend Validation Uncovers Issues**
- **Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium  
- **Mitigation**: Prepared to fix issues found during comprehensive testing
- **Contingency**: Document issues for future sprint if fixes too complex

### **Sprint Scope Flexibility**

**Minimum Viable Sprint** (if high risks materialize):
- Story 3.0.1: Infrastructure setup (8 SP)
- Story 3.0.2: Frontend validation (5 SP)  
- **Total**: 13 SP - Focus on foundation stability

**Optimal Sprint** (if infrastructure setup goes smoothly):
- All stories including stretch goal (20 SP)
- **Outcome**: Ready for advanced Political Strategist features next sprint
