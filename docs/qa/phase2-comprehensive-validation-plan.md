## 🧪 Test Strategy

### Phase A: Static Analysis & Code Review
1. **Directory Structure Validation**
   - Verify feature-based organization exists
   - Count and validate shared components
   - Check path aliases configuration
   - Validate barrel exports

2. **Build System Analysis**
   - Analyze bundle splitting configuration  
   - Verify lazy loading implementation
   - Test import resolution with new aliases
   - Validate compatibility layer

### Phase B: Runtime Functional Testing
1. **Application Launch & Basic Functionality**
   - Start dev server and verify load time
   - Test authentication flow
   - Validate dashboard rendering
   - Check ward selection functionality

2. **Component-Level Testing**
   - Dashboard orchestration and error boundaries
   - Analytics components (charts, trends)
   - Geographic components (map, ward selection)
   - Political Strategist integration
   - Shared component library usage

3. **Error Boundary & Resilience Testing**  
   - Simulate component failures
   - Verify error isolation
   - Test recovery mechanisms
   - Validate fallback UIs

### Phase C: Performance & Integration Testing
1. **Bundle Analysis**
   - Measure actual bundle sizes
   - Verify code splitting effectiveness
   - Test lazy loading behavior
   - Analyze network waterfall

2. **End-to-End User Workflows**
   - Complete political intelligence analysis workflow
   - Cross-component data flow validation
   - Multi-tab navigation testing
   - Real-time data updates

### Phase D: Quality Gate Decision
1. **Evidence Compilation**
   - Document all test results
   - Compare claims vs reality
   - Identify gaps and issues
   - Calculate actual success rate

2. **Recommendations & Action Items**
   - Priority fixes for any failures
   - Performance optimization opportunities
   - Documentation updates needed
   - Next steps for Phase 3 readiness

## 📊 Success Criteria

### Validation Thresholds
- **PASS**: 95%+ of claims validated with working functionality
- **CONCERNS**: 80-94% of claims validated with minor issues
- **FAIL**: <80% of claims validated or critical failures found

### Key Metrics to Measure
- **Load Time**: Actual vs claimed <2 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: Actual reduction percentage vs claimed 30%+
- **Component Isolation**: Error boundary effectiveness test
- **Feature Completeness**: All Phase 2 components functional

## 🔄 Living Document Updates

This validation plan will update:
- **Real-time findings** as testing progresses
- **Quality gate status** based on evidence
- **Story completion status** for related epics
- **Recommendations** for Phase 3 preparation
