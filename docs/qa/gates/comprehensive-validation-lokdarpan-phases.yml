# System Readiness Assessment
deployment_readiness:
  development: "✅ READY - System fully operational for continued development"
  testing: "⚠️ NEEDS_WORK - Test coverage improvements required"
  staging: "⚠️ PARTIAL - Core features ready, integration testing needed"
  production: "❌ NOT_READY - Address high-priority issues first"

# Quality Gate Decision Rationale
gate_rationale: |
  LokDarpan demonstrates exceptional architectural quality and political intelligence capabilities 
  across all three completed phases. The system successfully delivers:
  
  - Comprehensive sentiment analysis and real-time political intelligence
  - Advanced multi-party competitive analysis with time-series trending
  - AI-powered strategic response framework with multi-model orchestration
  - Robust security foundation with proper authentication and input validation
  - Clean, maintainable codebase with error boundary protection
  
  However, production deployment requires addressing critical gaps in test coverage (74% → 85%+), 
  completing Political Strategist integration, and implementing performance optimizations for 
  campaign-scale usage.
  
  The CONCERNS gate reflects the system's strong foundation while acknowledging targeted 
  improvements needed for high-stakes political campaign deployment.
