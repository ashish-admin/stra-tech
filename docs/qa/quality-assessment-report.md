## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigation Priority |
|--------------|-------------|--------|----------|--------------------|
| Test Suite Failures | HIGH | HIGH | CRITICAL | Immediate |
| Missing Integration Tests | HIGH | HIGH | CRITICAL | Immediate |
| AI Service Unavailability | MEDIUM | HIGH | HIGH | 24 hours |

## Quality Gate Decision

### Gate Status: **CONCERNS**

**Rationale**: While core functionality works and architecture is sound, the testing infrastructure requires immediate attention before production deployment.

### Critical Issues Requiring Resolution:

1. **Fix Integration Test Suite** (BLOCKER)
   - Resolve StrategistCache import error
   - Fix pytest configuration warnings
   - Enable coverage reporting

2. **SSE Reliability** (HIGH)
   - Fix connection recovery mechanisms
   - Implement proper retry logic
   - Add connection state management

3. **API Key Configuration** (HIGH)
   - Configure GEMINI_API_KEY
   - Implement key validation on startup
   - Add fallback for missing keys

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Sprint 1)

1. **Restore Test Suite** (3-5 days)
   ```bash
   # Fix import issues
   # Update strategist/cache.py exports
   # Configure pytest marks in pytest.ini
   ```

2. **Implement E2E Testing** (5-7 days)
   - Set up Playwright for critical user flows
   - Add login flow E2E test
   - Test ward selection and data visualization

3. **Fix SSE Implementation** (3-4 days)
   - Review EventSource connection logic
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Add connection state management

### Next Sprint Actions

1. **Increase Test Coverage** (Target: 80%)
   - Add unit tests for uncovered modules
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints
   - Add component tests for React components

2. **Performance Testing Framework**
   - Set up load testing with k6 or JMeter
   - Define performance benchmarks
   - Implement continuous performance monitoring

3. **Security Testing Enhancement**
   - Add penetration testing
   - Implement OWASP compliance checks
   - Add dependency vulnerability scanning

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Test Automation Pipeline**
   - CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
   - Automated test execution on PR
   - Coverage reporting and quality gates

2. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Application performance monitoring
   - Error tracking (Sentry integration)
   - User behavior analytics

3. **Documentation**
   - Test strategy documentation
   - Test case specifications
   - Performance benchmarks documentation

## Test Scenarios for Critical Paths

### Scenario 1: User Login and Dashboard Access
```gherkin
Given a user with valid credentials
When they submit the login form
Then they should be authenticated
And the dashboard should load with ward data
And all charts should render without errors
```

### Scenario 2: Ward Selection and Data Update
```gherkin
Given an authenticated user on the dashboard
When they select a different ward
Then all components should update with new ward data
And no components should crash
And the URL should reflect the selected ward
```

### Scenario 3: AI Strategic Analysis
```gherkin
Given the Political Strategist module is configured
When a user requests strategic analysis
Then the SSE connection should establish
And progress updates should stream
And analysis results should display
```

## Compliance & Standards

### Current Compliance Status
- ❌ **ISO 25010 Software Quality**: Partial (missing reliability metrics)
- ⚠️ **OWASP Security**: Basic implementation
- ❌ **WCAG 2.1 Accessibility**: Not validated
- ⚠️ **Performance Budget**: Undefined

### Required for Production
- [ ] 80% test coverage minimum
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities  
- [ ] < 3 second page load time
- [ ] 99.5% uptime SLA capability
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting system

## Conclusion

LokDarpan demonstrates strong architectural foundations and functional capabilities but requires significant quality assurance improvements before production deployment. The immediate priority should be restoring the test suite functionality and implementing comprehensive integration testing.

**Recommended Action**: Fix critical test infrastructure issues before proceeding with new feature development.
