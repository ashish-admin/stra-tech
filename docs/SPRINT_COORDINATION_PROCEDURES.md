### **Risk Tracking Matrix**

| Risk Item | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Status | Owner |
|-----------|-------------|---------|------------------|-------|
| Gemini API billing complexity | Medium | High | Documentation ready | API Architect |
| Redis setup issues | Low | Medium | Docker fallback prepared | DB Specialist |  
| QA validation uncovers major issues | Medium | Medium | Fix procedures defined | QA Lead |
| Infrastructure timeline overrun | Low | High | Scope flexibility planned | Business Analyst |

### **Blocker Escalation Process**

**Level 1: Technical Blocker** (Same day resolution)
- **Example**: Configuration issue, documentation unclear
- **Process**: Raise in standup, technical leads collaborate
- **Escalation**: If not resolved by end of day â†’ Level 2

**Level 2: Resource/Decision Blocker** (24-48 hour resolution)
- **Example**: Billing decisions, architecture changes needed
- **Process**: Business Analyst coordinates with Product Owner
- **Escalation**: If major timeline impact â†’ Level 3

**Level 3: Sprint Scope Impact** (Immediate attention)
- **Example**: Infrastructure fundamentally more complex than expected
- **Process**: Emergency sprint scope review and adjustment
- **Authority**: Product Owner decision with team input

## ðŸ“‹ **COORDINATION TOUCHPOINTS**

### **Cross-Track Dependencies**

**Infrastructure â†’ QA Validation**:
- **Dependency**: None - QA can proceed independently
- **Coordination**: Share any infrastructure findings that affect frontend
- **Timeline**: QA completion by Day 5, Infrastructure by Day 7

**Infrastructure â†’ Documentation**:
- **Dependency**: Infrastructure setup procedures and health monitoring setup
- **Coordination**: API Architect provides technical documentation
- **Timeline**: Documentation updates as infrastructure components complete

**QA Validation â†’ Sprint Planning**:
- **Dependency**: QA results inform future sprint capacity planning  
- **Coordination**: QA validation report ready by Day 5 for review
- **Impact**: Determines next sprint scope and resource allocation

### **Weekly Sprint Review Structure**

**End of Week 1 Review** (Day 5 - 30 minutes):
- **Infrastructure progress assessment**: On track for Week 2 completion?
- **QA validation preliminary results**: Major issues discovered?
- **Risk reassessment**: Any new blockers or timeline concerns?
- **Week 2 scope confirmation**: Adjust sprint scope if needed

**Sprint Retrospective** (Day 10 - 45 minutes):
- **Sprint goal achievement**: Infrastructure operational and validated?
- **Process improvement**: What coordination worked well/needs improvement?
- **Next sprint readiness**: Foundation established for advanced features?
- **Lessons learned**: Documentation updates and process refinements
