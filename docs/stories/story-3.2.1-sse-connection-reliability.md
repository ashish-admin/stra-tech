# Story 3.2.1: SSE Connection Reliability - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **political campaign strategist**,
I want **robust SSE connections that automatically recover from network issues and maintain real-time political intelligence streaming**,
So that **I never miss critical political developments due to connection problems and can rely on continuous strategic insights**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: strategist/router.py (SSE endpoints), frontend SSE client code, React components receiving real-time updates
- Technology: Flask SSE streaming, React frontend with EventSource API, network connection management
- Follows pattern: Existing SSE architecture with Flask streaming and React client connection handling
- Touch points: SSE endpoint reliability, client connection management, network error handling, real-time data flow

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Connection Recovery Mechanisms**: SSE connections automatically detect disconnections and initiate recovery within 2 seconds using exponential backoff retry logic
2. **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Client and server maintain heartbeat signals every 30 seconds to detect connection health and trigger recovery before complete disconnection
3. **Automatic Reconnection Logic**: When connections fail, client automatically reconnects with session continuity, resuming real-time updates without data loss or user intervention

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing SSE streaming functionality continues to work unchanged with enhanced reliability transparent to users
5. New connection reliability follows existing SSE architecture pattern without breaking current React component integration
6. Integration with strategist/router.py maintains current SSE endpoint behavior while adding reliability enhancements

**Quality Requirements:**

7. SSE connections self-heal within 5 seconds of any network disruption
8. Connection recovery succeeds >99% of the time for temporary network issues
9. No data loss during reconnection for ongoing political analysis streams

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Enhance existing SSE client with connection monitoring and recovery logic, add heartbeat mechanisms to Flask SSE endpoints, implement session continuity for reconnections
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing SSE architecture with Flask streaming endpoints and React EventSource client pattern
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain current SSE data format and client interface, cannot introduce blocking operations in main streaming flow

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Connection recovery mechanisms implemented and tested under various network failure scenarios
- [ ] Heartbeat monitoring operational between client and server with proper health detection
- [ ] Automatic reconnection tested with session continuity and data integrity verification
- [ ] Integration requirements verified through comprehensive testing
- [ ] Existing SSE streaming functionality regression tested
- [ ] Recovery time meets 5-second target for all network disruption types
- [ ] Code follows existing SSE architecture patterns and standards
- [ ] Documentation updated for enhanced connection reliability capabilities

## Status
**DRAFT** - Implementation incomplete. Connection recovery and heartbeat monitoring missing.

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Connection recovery logic could create infinite reconnection loops or interfere with normal SSE operation
- **Mitigation**: Exponential backoff with maximum retry limits, connection state tracking to prevent loops, feature flag for gradual rollout
- **Rollback**: Disable connection recovery feature flag to revert to current SSE client behavior, no server-side changes required

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing SSE endpoint data format or client interface
- [x] Enhanced connection handling is transparent to existing React components
- [x] Performance impact is positive (improved reliability and user experience)
- [x] No database or significant infrastructure changes required

## Effort Estimation

**Story Points**: 3  
**Technical Complexity**: Medium  
**Integration Risk**: Low  
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours focused development
