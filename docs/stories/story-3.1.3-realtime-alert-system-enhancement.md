# Story 3.1.3: Real-time Alert System Enhancement - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **political campaign strategist**,
I want **proactive alerts for critical political events with intelligent prioritization and real-time delivery**,
So that **I can respond immediately to political developments and maintain competitive advantages during campaigns**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: existing alert system, strategist/router.py (SSE streaming), app/models.py (Alert model), Celery task processing
- Technology: Flask backend with SSE streaming, Celery async processing, Redis for real-time event processing, React frontend alert components
- Follows pattern: Existing alert and notification architecture with SSE streaming and async task processing
- Touch points: Alert generation logic, event-driven notifications, priority classification, SSE streaming enhancement

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Proactive Alert Generation**: System automatically detects and generates alerts for critical political events (polling changes, policy announcements, opponent activities, crisis situations) within 30 seconds of data ingestion
2. **Event-Driven Notifications**: Real-time alert delivery through SSE streaming to connected campaign dashboards with immediate push notifications for high-priority events
3. **Alert Prioritization Logic**: Intelligent classification of alerts (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) based on campaign context, ward relevance, timing, and potential impact on electoral outcomes

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing alert functionality continues to work unchanged with enhanced real-time capabilities seamlessly integrated
5. New alert system follows existing SSE streaming pattern and maintains compatibility with current dashboard components
6. Integration with existing Alert model and dashboard AlertsPanel.jsx component maintains current functionality while adding real-time enhancements

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Critical political events trigger alerts within 30 seconds of detection
8. Alert system maintains 99.5% uptime during campaign periods with robust error handling
9. Alert relevance accuracy >85% (campaign teams find alerts actionable and valuable)

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Enhance existing alert generation with real-time event processing, upgrade SSE streaming for immediate alert delivery, add intelligent prioritization as analysis pipeline component
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing alert and SSE streaming architecture with async Celery processing and Redis event handling
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain current alert functionality, cannot overwhelm users with false positives, must handle high-volume political event periods

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Proactive alert generation operational for all political event types
- [ ] Event-driven notifications tested with SSE streaming delivery
- [ ] Alert prioritization logic validated against historical political events
- [ ] Integration requirements verified through comprehensive testing
- [ ] Existing alert functionality regression tested
- [ ] Real-time delivery meets 30-second performance target
- [ ] Alert relevance meets 85% accuracy threshold
- [ ] Documentation updated for enhanced alert system capabilities

## Status
**DRAFT** - Implementation incomplete. Proactive alert generation and prioritization logic missing.

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Alert overload could overwhelm campaign teams or false positives could reduce trust in alert system
- **Mitigation**: Intelligent filtering with user preference controls, gradual rollout with feedback collection, alert volume monitoring and adjustment
- **Rollback**: Disable proactive alert generation while maintaining existing manual alert functionality, no impact on current workflows

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing Alert model or API endpoints
- [x] Database changes are additive only (new alert priority and event type fields)
- [x] SSE streaming enhanced without breaking existing client connections
- [x] Dashboard alert components maintain current functionality with real-time enhancements

## Effort Estimation

**Story Points**: 3  
**Technical Complexity**: Medium  
**Integration Risk**: Low  
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours focused development
