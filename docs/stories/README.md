### ⚡ Phase 5 - EMERGENCY EPIC 🚨 ACTIVE 
**Goal**: IMMEDIATE activation of completed Phase 3/4 infrastructure for campaign team access  
**Critical Issue**: $200K+ development investment technically complete but inaccessible via main UI  
**Current Sprint**: Epic 5.0 - Dashboard Activation Crisis Resolution (P0 - IMMEDIATE)

| Epic | Story | Status | Points | Priority |
|------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 5.0 | App.jsx Dashboard Integration Emergency | 📋 Ready | 8 | P0 - CRITICAL |

**Epic 5.0 Stories**:
- **5.0.1**: App.jsx Dashboard Integration Emergency (Ready for implementation)

**Total**: 8 story points (emergency implementation required)

### 🚨 PHASE 5.0 EMERGENCY CONTEXT
**Business Impact**: Completed Phase 3/4 features ($200K+ investment) currently inaccessible  
**Root Cause**: App.jsx shows status page instead of complete dashboard integration  
**Solution Available**: App.jsx.backup contains proper dashboard with QueryClientProvider, WardProvider integration  
**Timeline**: 48-72 hours for immediate resolution

**Post-Emergency Phase 5 Ultra-Enhancement Roadmap** (Ready for formal story creation):
- **Phase 5.1**: Intelligent State Orchestra (4-6 weeks)
- **Phase 5.2**: Adaptive Political Interface (4-6 weeks)  
- **Phase 5.3**: Zero-Trust Security Evolution (3-4 weeks)
- **Phase 5.4**: Collaborative Intelligence Platform (5-7 weeks)

## Development Guidelines

### Story Acceptance Criteria Standards
All stories must include:
- **Functional Requirements**: Clear, testable user functionality
- **Integration Requirements**: Compatibility with existing system
- **Quality Requirements**: Performance, reliability, user experience

### Brownfield Development Rules
1. **No Regression**: All existing functionality must continue working
2. **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to APIs or interfaces  
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify new features work with existing system
4. **Rollback Plan**: Every enhancement must have defined rollback procedure

### Definition of Done Checklist
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Integration testing with existing system complete
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested and documented

## Sprint Planning Guidelines

### Story Point Estimation
- **1-2 SP**: Simple enhancements, following existing patterns
- **3-5 SP**: Moderate complexity, some new development
- **8+ SP**: Complex features, significant integration work

### Sprint Capacity Planning
- **Development Team**: 20 story points per 2-week sprint
- **Buffer**: Reserve 10% capacity for unexpected issues
- **Quality Gates**: Include testing and integration validation time

### Risk Management
- **High-Risk Stories**: Require proof-of-concept before sprint commitment
- **Dependencies**: Map inter-story dependencies clearly
- **Integration Points**: Identify all existing system touch points
