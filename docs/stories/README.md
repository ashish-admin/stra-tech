## Development Guidelines

### Story Acceptance Criteria Standards
All stories must include:
- **Functional Requirements**: Clear, testable user functionality
- **Integration Requirements**: Compatibility with existing system
- **Quality Requirements**: Performance, reliability, user experience

### Brownfield Development Rules
1. **No Regression**: All existing functionality must continue working
2. **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to APIs or interfaces  
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify new features work with existing system
4. **Rollback Plan**: Every enhancement must have defined rollback procedure

### Definition of Done Checklist
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Integration testing with existing system complete
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested and documented

## Sprint Planning Guidelines

### Story Point Estimation
- **1-2 SP**: Simple enhancements, following existing patterns
- **3-5 SP**: Moderate complexity, some new development
- **8+ SP**: Complex features, significant integration work

### Sprint Capacity Planning
- **Development Team**: 20 story points per 2-week sprint
- **Buffer**: Reserve 10% capacity for unexpected issues
- **Quality Gates**: Include testing and integration validation time

### Risk Management
- **High-Risk Stories**: Require proof-of-concept before sprint commitment
- **Dependencies**: Map inter-story dependencies clearly
- **Integration Points**: Identify all existing system touch points
