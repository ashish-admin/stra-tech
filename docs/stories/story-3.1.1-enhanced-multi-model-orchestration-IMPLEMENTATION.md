# Story 3.1.1: Enhanced Multi-Model Orchestration - Implementation Plan

**Sprint**: Phase 3 Completion Sprint  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Ready for Implementation  
**Created**: 2025-08-27  

## Story Overview

As a **Political Campaign Manager**, I want **intelligent AI model routing and orchestration** so that **I receive the highest quality strategic analysis by leveraging the best AI model for each specific analysis type**.

## Current System Analysis

### âœ… Existing Infrastructure (Built)
- `MultiModelCoordinator` class in `backend/strategist/reasoner/multi_model_coordinator.py`
- Basic parallel execution of Gemini 2.5 Pro and Perplexity AI
- Evidence aggregation and confidence scoring framework
- SSE streaming infrastructure in frontend
- Frontend PoliticalStrategist component with streaming support

### ðŸ”§ Enhancement Areas Identified
1. **Intelligent Model Selection**: Current system runs both models in parallel - needs smart routing
2. **Conversation Awareness**: Basic conversation context but not optimized for continuity
3. **Quality Optimization**: Evidence aggregation exists but needs refinement
4. **Performance Optimization**: No caching or adaptive timeout strategies
5. **Error Recovery**: Basic fallback but needs intelligent recovery patterns

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend Enhancements (`backend/strategist/reasoner/multi_model_coordinator.py`)

#### 1. Intelligent Model Router (2 Story Points)
```python
class IntelligentModelRouter:
    """Routes analysis requests to optimal AI model based on query characteristics."""
    
    def determine_optimal_model(self, request: AnalysisRequest) -> ModelRoutingDecision:
        """
        Intelligent routing based on:
        - Query type (factual vs strategic vs conversational)
        - Real-time requirements (breaking news vs deep analysis)
        - Conversation context (follow-up vs new topic)
        - Historical performance for similar queries
        """
        
    def create_routing_strategy(self, request: AnalysisRequest) -> RoutingStrategy:
        """
        Creates execution strategy:
        - GEMINI_ONLY: Complex strategic reasoning
        - PERPLEXITY_ONLY: Real-time fact gathering
        - PARALLEL_SYNTHESIS: Comprehensive analysis
        - SEQUENTIAL_HANDOFF: Multi-stage analysis
        """
```

**File Changes Required**:
- Enhance `MultiModelCoordinator.coordinate_strategic_analysis()`
- Add `IntelligentModelRouter` class
- Create `ModelPerformanceTracker` for historical performance tracking
- Update routing logic to use intelligent selection instead of always parallel

#### 2. Enhanced Conversation Continuity (1.5 Story Points)
```python
class ConversationContextManager:
    """Manages conversation state and context optimization."""
    
    def extract_conversation_intent(self, history: List[Dict]) -> ConversationIntent:
        """Analyzes conversation history to determine user intent and context."""
        
    def optimize_context_for_model(self, context: ConversationContext, model: str) -> str:
        """Optimizes context delivery for specific model capabilities."""
```

**File Changes Required**:
- Add conversation intent analysis to `AnalysisRequest`
- Enhance context passing in `_gemini_analysis()` and `_perplexity_analysis()`
- Implement conversation continuity scoring in `_calculate_confidence_metrics()`

#### 3. Adaptive Quality Optimization (1 Story Point)
```python
class AdaptiveQualityOptimizer:
    """Dynamically adjusts analysis parameters based on quality feedback."""
    
    def calculate_quality_score(self, response: StrategicResponse) -> QualityMetrics:
        """Calculates multi-dimensional quality score."""
        
    def adjust_analysis_parameters(self, quality_history: List[QualityMetrics]) -> AnalysisParameters:
        """Adapts parameters based on quality feedback."""
```

**File Changes Required**:
- Enhance `_calculate_confidence_metrics()` with quality scoring
- Add feedback loop for quality improvement
- Implement adaptive timeout and retry strategies

#### 4. Caching and Performance Layer (0.5 Story Points)
```python
class StrategicAnalysisCache:
    """Intelligent caching for strategic analysis results."""
    
    def generate_cache_key(self, request: AnalysisRequest) -> str:
        """Smart cache key generation considering context sensitivity."""
        
    def is_cache_valid(self, cache_entry: CacheEntry, request: AnalysisRequest) -> bool:
        """Determines cache validity based on time sensitivity and context changes."""
```

**File Changes Required**:
- Add caching layer to `coordinate_strategic_analysis()`
- Implement cache invalidation strategies for real-time updates
- Add cache warming for frequently accessed wards

### Frontend Integration Enhancements

#### Enhanced Streaming UI Components
**File**: `frontend/src/features/strategist/components/PoliticalStrategist.jsx`

```javascript
// Add intelligent model selection UI
const [modelStrategy, setModelStrategy] = useState('auto');

// Enhanced progress tracking for multi-stage analysis
const [analysisStages, setAnalysisStages] = useState([]);

// Quality feedback mechanism
const handleQualityFeedback = (rating, feedback) => {
  // Send quality feedback to backend for learning
};
```
