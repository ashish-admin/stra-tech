# Story 4.3.3: StrategicTimeline Component - Event-based Political Development Tracking

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** campaign strategist analyzing political developments over time,
**I want** an interactive timeline visualization of key political events, sentiment shifts, and strategic developments,
**so that** I can understand the sequence of political events, identify cause-and-effect relationships, and make informed strategic decisions based on historical political patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Event-based Timeline Visualization**: Interactive horizontal timeline displaying political events, sentiment changes, alerts, and strategic developments with chronological accuracy
2. **Multi-source Event Integration**: Combine data from intelligence alerts, sentiment analysis milestones, party mentions, and significant political developments into unified timeline
3. **Interactive Navigation**: Zoom, pan, and filter controls with date range selection, event type filtering, and jump-to-date functionality
4. **Event Detail Display**: Click on timeline events to show detailed context, related sentiment data, source information, and strategic implications
5. **Real-time Timeline Updates**: Integration with SSE streaming for live political event additions and timeline updates without manual refresh
6. **Strategic Context Visualization**: Show correlation between events and sentiment changes with connecting lines and impact indicators
7. **Mobile-responsive Timeline**: Touch-optimized timeline navigation with gesture support and mobile-friendly event detail display

- **React 18**: Component lifecycle management for timeline updates and event handling
- **SVG Rendering**: Scalable vector graphics for timeline precision across zoom levels
- **Date Manipulation**: JavaScript Date API with timezone handling for political event accuracy

### Data Sources and API Integration
[Source: CLAUDE.md - Key API Endpoints]
- **Intelligence Alerts**: `/api/v1/alerts/{ward}` provides categorized political alerts for timeline events
- **Sentiment Trends**: `/api/v1/trends?ward={ward}&days={days}` for sentiment milestone identification
- **Political Analysis**: Political Strategist analysis results for strategic development markers
- **SSE Streaming**: Real-time political intelligence updates for live timeline event additions

### Event Data Model and Categorization
[Source: backend/app/models.py - Alert model structure]
- **Event Types**: Intelligence alerts, sentiment peaks, party activity spikes, strategic analysis milestones

- **Timeline Positioning**: Chronological accuracy with timezone handling for precise political event sequencing
- **Event Relationships**: Connect related events showing cause-and-effect political developments

### Timeline Visualization Specifications
**Timeline Layout**:
- Horizontal timeline with date axis at bottom, events plotted above with varying heights by importance
- Event clustering for high-density periods with zoom-to-expand functionality
