# Epic 3.1: Advanced Strategic Reasoning Engine - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Complete the LokDarpan Political Strategist multi-model AI orchestration system to provide intelligent model routing, enhanced credibility scoring, and proactive alert generation that delivers decisive competitive advantages for political campaigns.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Political Strategist module with basic multi-model AI integration (Gemini 2.5 Pro + Perplexity AI), SSE streaming infrastructure, and core analysis pipeline
- Technology stack: Flask backend with Celery task processing, Redis caching, pgvector embeddings, React frontend with SSE client
- Integration points: strategist/service.py (core orchestration), strategist/router.py (API endpoints), strategist/nlp/pipeline.py (analysis), strategist/reasoner/ultra_think.py (reasoning engine)

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Completing intelligent model routing, credibility scoring system, fact-checking integration, bias detection mechanisms, and proactive alert generation with event-driven notifications
- How it integrates: Enhances existing strategist module components without breaking current functionality, adds new orchestration layers and quality assurance pipelines
- Success criteria: 99%+ availability for strategic analysis, all analyses include credibility scores, critical political events trigger alerts within 30 seconds, intelligent routing optimizes AI service usage

## Stories

1. **Story 3.1.1:** Enhanced Multi-Model Orchestration - Intelligent routing based on query complexity with fallback chains and confidence scoring across models
2. **Story 3.1.2:** Strategic Analysis Pipeline Completion - Complete credibility scoring, fact-checking integration, and bias detection mechanisms
3. **Story 3.1.3:** Real-time Alert System Enhancement - Proactive alert generation with event-driven notifications and prioritization logic

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged - current /api/v1/strategist endpoints maintain compatibility
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible - new tables for credibility scoring and alerts, no existing table modifications
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns - enhancements to existing React components, no breaking changes to component interfaces
- [x] Performance impact is minimal - intelligent caching and routing improve performance, no degradation to existing functionality

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Service disruption during enhanced orchestration deployment affecting existing political analysis functionality
- **Mitigation:** Feature flags for new orchestration logic, gradual rollout with A/B testing, maintain existing service paths as fallback
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable feature flags to revert to current orchestration logic, rollback database migrations for new tables, Redis cache flush for new routing logic

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing - political analysis continues working during enhancement
- [x] Integration points working correctly - strategist module maintains current API contract
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately - API documentation and integration guides updated
- [x] No regression in existing features - comprehensive regression testing of current political analysis workflows

## Success Metrics

- **Availability**: 99%+ uptime for strategic analysis services
- **Quality**: 100% of analyses include credibility scores and fact-checking results
- **Performance**: Alert generation <30 seconds for critical political events
- **Efficiency**: 40% reduction in AI service costs through intelligent routing
- **User Experience**: No disruption to existing campaign team workflows
