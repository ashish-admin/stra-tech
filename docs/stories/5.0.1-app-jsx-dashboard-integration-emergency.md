## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Insights**
Based on Quinn QA comprehensive validation (96% production ready), all Phase 3-4 infrastructure is technically complete and operational. The gap is purely integration - connecting completed backend capabilities to the main user interface.

### **Critical Integration Context**
- **Current State**: App.jsx shows basic status page instead of full dashboard
- **Available Solution**: App.jsx.backup contains complete dashboard integration
- **Technical Debt**: Zero - this is purely an activation task, not new development
- **Risk Level**: LOW - all infrastructure already validated and operational

### **File Locations and Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Target File**: `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Root application component
- **Backup Source**: `frontend/src/App.jsx.backup` - Complete dashboard integration
- **Dashboard Component**: `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` - Main application interface
- **Context Providers**: `frontend/src/contexts/WardContext.jsx` - Global ward selection state
- **PWA Components**: `frontend/src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/OfflineIndicator.jsx`

### **Architecture Dependencies** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **React Query**: Server state management with React Query (TanStack Query)
- **React Context**: Global application state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling consistency
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundary implementation for component isolation
- **PWA Architecture**: Progressive Web App with service worker integration

### **Component Integration Requirements** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-key-files]
```jsx
// Required provider structure from App.jsx.backup
<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
  <WardProvider>
    <PWAProvider>
      <DashboardErrorBoundary componentName="LokDarpan Main Application">
        <Dashboard currentUser={user} />
      </DashboardErrorBoundary>
    </PWAProvider>
  </WardProvider>
</QueryClientProvider>
```

### **Phase 3/4 Integration Points**
- **Political Strategist**: Access via Dashboard component integration with backend `/api/v1/strategist` endpoints
- **Error Boundaries**: Already implemented in `frontend/src/shared/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx`
- **SSE Integration**: Enhanced SSE client at `frontend/src/features/strategist/services/enhancedSSEClient.js`
- **PWA Features**: Service worker at `frontend/public/sw.js` with offline capabilities

### **Authentication Integration** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#authentication]
- **Session-based Auth**: Maintain existing Flask-Login session management
- **CSRF Protection**: Preserve token-based CSRF protection
- **Security Headers**: Ensure CORS and security headers remain configured

### **Performance Considerations** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#frontend-performance]
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor that integration doesn't exceed 500KB initial bundle target
- **Load Time**: Maintain < 2s initial page load requirement
- **Mobile Performance**: Ensure mobile optimization is preserved

## Testing

### **Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- **Test Location**: `frontend/src/test/` for component tests
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 70% component test coverage
- **E2E Testing**: Critical user workflows covered with Playwright
- **Integration Testing**: All API endpoints tested for connectivity

### **Required Test Cases**
1. **Authentication Flow**: Login/logout functionality with session persistence
2. **Dashboard Loading**: Complete dashboard renders without errors
3. **Component Isolation**: Error in one component doesn't crash entire dashboard
4. **PWA Features**: Offline indicator and install prompt functionality
5. **Ward Selection**: Context management and API integration
6. **SSE Connectivity**: Real-time streaming connection and recovery
7. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch interactions and responsive layout

### **Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#development-tools]
- **Unit Tests**: React Testing Library + Jest
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical user flows
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor Core Web Vitals during integration

### **Rollback Testing**
- Verify App.jsx.status backup can restore original functionality
- Test rollback procedure under simulated failure scenarios
- Validate emergency rollback doesn't affect database or backend services
