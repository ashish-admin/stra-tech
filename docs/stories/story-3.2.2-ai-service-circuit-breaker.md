# Story 3.2.2: AI Service Circuit Breaker - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **political campaign strategist**,
I want **automatic failover and graceful degradation when AI services become unavailable**,
So that **my strategic analysis continues working even when individual AI services fail, ensuring continuous campaign intelligence**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: AI service clients (Gemini, Perplexity, local Llama), strategist/orchestration/router.py, service health monitoring
- Technology: Flask backend with AI service integration, Redis for service health caching, Celery for async processing
- Follows pattern: Existing AI service architecture with client abstraction and error handling
- Touch points: AI service clients, orchestration logic, error handling, service health monitoring, fallback mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Circuit Breaker Implementation**: Automatic circuit breaker pattern that opens when AI service error rate exceeds 50% over 1-minute window, preventing cascade failures
2. **Service Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of AI service response times, error rates, and availability with health status tracking in Redis
3. **Graceful Degradation**: When primary AI service fails, system automatically routes requests to available services with appropriate capability matching and user notification

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing AI service functionality continues to work unchanged with enhanced reliability transparent to users
5. New circuit breaker follows existing AI service client pattern without breaking current orchestration logic
6. Integration with strategist/orchestration/ maintains current API behavior while adding failure protection

**Quality Requirements:**

7. System remains fully functional when any single AI service fails with <2 second failover time
8. Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures and automatically recovers when services restore
9. Service health monitoring provides accurate status with <30 second detection time for failures

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Implement circuit breaker pattern in existing AI service clients, enhance orchestration router with health-aware routing, add Redis-based health monitoring
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing AI service client abstraction pattern with error handling and async processing
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain current AI service API compatibility, cannot introduce significant latency in normal operation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Circuit breaker implemented for all AI service clients with proper failure detection
- [ ] Service health monitoring operational with accurate status tracking
- [ ] Graceful degradation tested under various AI service failure scenarios
- [ ] Integration requirements verified through comprehensive testing
- [ ] Existing AI service functionality regression tested
- [ ] Failover time meets <2 second target for service switching
- [ ] Circuit breaker recovery tested when services come back online
- [ ] Documentation updated for enhanced AI service reliability

## Status
**DRAFT** - Implementation incomplete. Circuit breaker pattern and service health monitoring missing.

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Circuit breaker logic could incorrectly mark healthy services as failed, reducing system capability
- **Mitigation**: Conservative failure thresholds with proper hysteresis, comprehensive testing of failure detection, monitoring and alerting for circuit breaker state changes
- **Rollback**: Disable circuit breaker logic to revert to current direct AI service calls, maintain existing error handling patterns

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing AI service client interfaces
- [x] Orchestration logic enhanced without changing current API responses
- [x] Performance impact is positive (prevents resource waste on failed services)
- [x] Redis usage is additive only (service health status caching)

## Effort Estimation

**Story Points**: 3  
**Technical Complexity**: Medium  
**Integration Risk**: Low  
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours focused development
