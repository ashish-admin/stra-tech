# Epic 4.1: Complete Error Boundary Implementation - Realistic Scope

## Epic Goal

Complete the error boundary implementation started in LokDarpan to ensure single component failures never crash the dashboard, providing campaign teams with reliable access to political intelligence even when individual components encounter errors.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Foundation:**

- Current assets: ComponentErrorBoundary.jsx exists in multiple locations, ErrorBoundary.jsx implemented, ErrorFallback.jsx component available
- Technology stack: React 18 + Vite 7 + TailwindCSS + React Query + Leaflet, proven component-based architecture
- Integration points: Dashboard.jsx (main container), LocationMap, StrategicSummary, TimeSeriesChart, CompetitorTrendChart, AlertsPanel components

**Realistic Enhancement Scope:**

- What's being completed: Finish error boundary wrapping for all critical components, implement component-specific fallback UIs, add basic error context management
- How it integrates: Build on existing ComponentErrorBoundary.jsx, wrap remaining components, enhance Dashboard.jsx error handling
- Success criteria: Complete component isolation, working fallback UIs, basic error recovery

## Stories

1. **Story 4.1.1:** Complete Component Error Boundary Wrapping - Finish wrapping all critical components with existing ComponentErrorBoundary
2. **Story 4.1.2:** Implement Component-Specific Fallback UIs - Create tailored fallback interfaces for map, charts, and summary components

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged - no changes to component props or callback interfaces
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible - no backend changes required for error boundaries
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns - error boundaries enhance existing components without breaking functionality
- [x] Performance impact is minimal - error boundaries add minimal overhead only during error conditions

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Error boundary implementation could interfere with existing component rendering or state management
- **Mitigation:** Incremental component wrapping with testing, error boundaries only activate during actual errors, maintain existing component interfaces
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove error boundary wrappers to revert to current component rendering, no data or state changes to rollback

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Existing functionality verified - all components continue working normally with error boundary protection
- [ ] Integration points working correctly - error boundaries transparent during normal operation  
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately - error handling patterns and recovery procedures documented
- [ ] No regression in existing features - comprehensive testing of all dashboard functionality

## Success Metrics

- **Isolation**: 100% component failure isolation (no cascade failures between components)
- **Availability**: Dashboard remains functional when individual components fail
- **User Experience**: Clear error communication with simple recovery options
- **Implementation**: All critical components properly wrapped with error boundaries

## Status
**DRAFT** - Simplified scope focused on completing existing error boundary foundation.
