# Team Review Task - Story 1.1 Component Error Boundary Foundation

## Story Title
Team Review & Validation - Component Error Boundary Foundation Approach

## User Story
As a **Product Manager**,
I want **all team members to review and provide feedback on Story 1.1 technical approach**,
So that **we can validate our error boundary implementation strategy before beginning the comprehensive LokDarpan enhancement**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: React 18 Dashboard, LocationMap, StrategicSummary, TimeSeriesChart components
- Technology: React 18 + Vite 7 + TailwindCSS + React Query
- Follows pattern: React Error Boundary pattern with custom fallback UI
- Touch points: All critical dashboard components requiring resilience

**Review Scope:**
- Document: `docs/async-review-story-1-1.md`
- Teams Involved: Backend, Frontend, UI/UX, QA, DevOps
- Timeline: 3-5 days review period + 1-2 days consolidation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Review Participation Requirements:**
1. Backend team reviews error tracking and monitoring integration requirements
2. Frontend team validates component wrapping strategy and React Query interaction approach
3. UI/UX team approves fallback component design consistency with TailwindCSS system
4. QA team confirms testing methodology for <5% performance overhead requirement
5. DevOps team validates monitoring and deployment considerations

**Feedback Collection Requirements:**
6. Each team provides written feedback on their specific review questions
7. Technical concerns or risks are documented with proposed mitigations
8. Alternative approaches (if any) are suggested with pros/cons analysis
9. Go/No-Go recommendation provided by each team

**Integration Validation Requirements:**
10. Confirm existing Dashboard functionality will remain intact
11. Verify ward selection and data filtering can continue during component errors
12. Validate performance impact assessment methodology

**Decision Requirements:**
13. Consensus reached on component wrapping strategy
14. Agreement on error recovery UX patterns
15. Approval of technical implementation approach

## Technical Review Points

### Proposed Implementation for Review
```javascript
// ComponentErrorBoundary.jsx - For team technical review
class ComponentErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { 
      hasError: false, 
      error: null,
      retryCount: 0
    };
  }
  
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true, error };
  }
  
  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // Backend team: Review logging approach
    console.error('LokDarpan Component Error:', {
      component: this.props.componentName,
      error: error.toString(),
      errorInfo,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
    
    // Send to backend for tracking
    // API endpoint to be reviewed by backend team
    if (window.lokdarpanErrorTracking) {
      window.lokdarpanErrorTracking.logError({
        component: this.props.componentName,
        error: error.toString(),
        stack: errorInfo.componentStack
      });
    }
  }
  
  retry = () => {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      hasError: false,
      error: null,
      retryCount: prevState.retryCount + 1
    }));
  }
  
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // UI/UX team: Review fallback design
      return (
        <div className="border border-red-200 bg-red-50 rounded-lg p-4">
          <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-red-800 font-medium">
                {this.props.componentName} temporarily unavailable
              </h3>
              <p className="text-red-600 text-sm mt-1">
                Other dashboard features remain functional
              </p>
            </div>
            {this.state.retryCount < 3 && (
              <button
                onClick={this.retry}
                className="px-4 py-2 bg-red-600 text-white rounded hover:bg-red-700"
              >
                Retry
              </button>
            )}
          </div>
          {this.props.fallback && this.props.fallback()}
        </div>
      );
    }
    
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```
