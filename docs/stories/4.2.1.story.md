# Story 4.2.1: SSE Client Infrastructure

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** campaign manager using LokDarpan during critical political periods,
**I want** robust real-time streaming infrastructure for Political Strategist analysis,
**so that** I can monitor long-running AI analysis progress and receive strategic insights as they become available without connection interruptions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **SSE Client Service**: Implement SSEClient.js service with connection management, event parsing, and automatic reconnection logic
2. **Connection State Management**: Provide clear connection status indicators (connecting, connected, error, reconnecting) with user feedback
3. **Event Parsing and Routing**: Parse SSE event streams and route different event types (progress, analysis, completion, error) to appropriate handlers  
4. **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff strategy when connections fail or timeout
5. **Integration Compatibility**: SSE client integrates seamlessly with existing React Query data fetching without conflicts
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for connection failures, malformed events, and timeout scenarios
7. **Performance**: SSE connections maintain low latency (<2 seconds) for real-time updates and don't impact existing dashboard performance

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Core SSE Client Service Implementation (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create SSEClient.js service in `frontend/src/services/websocket.js` with EventSource management

  - [ ] Implement event routing to different subscriber callbacks based on event type

- [ ] Task 2: Connection State Management (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Implement connection status tracking with states (CONNECTING, CONNECTED, ERROR, RECONNECTING)
  - [ ] Create exponential backoff reconnection strategy with maximum retry limits
  - [ ] Add connection health monitoring with heartbeat detection
  - [ ] Implement manual reconnection controls for user-initiated retry

- [ ] Task 3: React Integration Hooks (AC: 5)

  - [ ] Implement useStrategistSSE hook specific for Political Strategist streaming
  - [ ] Add SSE state management that doesn't conflict with React Query cache
  - [ ] Create cleanup mechanisms for component unmounting and connection disposal

- [ ] Task 4: Error Handling and Resilience (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling for network failures, timeouts, and malformed data
  - [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms with user notification and retry options
  - [ ] Create fallback polling mechanism when SSE repeatedly fails
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring to ensure SSE doesn't impact existing dashboard performance

- [ ] Task 5: Testing and Integration Verification (AC: 1-7)
  - [ ] Unit tests for SSEClient service with mocked EventSource
  - [ ] Integration tests with existing React Query data fetching
  - [ ] Connection failure and recovery scenario testing
  - [ ] Performance testing to verify <2 second latency requirement

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.1.2 (Critical Component Isolation): Successfully implemented comprehensive component error boundaries with 100% success rate. The error boundary foundation provides the perfect infrastructure for SSE component resilience - if SSE streaming fails, it won't crash other dashboard components.

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-stack]
- **React 18**: Component-based UI library with modern hooks support
- **Vite**: Build tool with hot reload and proxy support for SSE development
- **React Query (TanStack Query)**: Server state management - SSE integration must not conflict with existing caching
- **Custom Hooks**: Pattern for reusable state logic - useSSE.js should follow established patterns

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-directory-structure]
- **Primary SSE Service**: `frontend/src/services/websocket.js` (mentioned as existing WebSocket/SSE client)
- **Custom Hook Location**: `frontend/src/hooks/useSSE.js` (Server-sent events hook location)
- **Strategist Service Integration**: `frontend/src/services/strategist.js` (Political strategist API service)
- **Component Integration**: Will integrate with existing component structure without breaking current patterns

### API Integration Requirements
[Source: CLAUDE.md - Political Strategist Module Phase 3]
- **SSE Endpoint**: Backend provides `/api/v1/strategist/feed` endpoint for SSE streaming
- **Authentication**: Session-based auth with secure cookies must be maintained for SSE connections
- **Event Format**: SSE events follow political analysis streaming format (progress, analysis_update, completion, error)
- **Connection Management**: Backend supports multiple concurrent SSE connections with proper resource management

### Error Handling Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#error-handling]
- **Fail Fast**: Detect SSE connection errors early and explicitly
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle SSE failures without system crashes - fallback to polling
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear connection status messages for campaign teams
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Include context for debugging SSE connection issues

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]
- **Real-time Latency**: <2 seconds for SSE event delivery (meets requirement)
- **Frontend Performance**: <2s initial page load must be maintained with SSE integration
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor SSE connections for memory leaks during long campaign sessions
- **Mobile Performance**: SSE must work reliably on mobile devices for field operations

### Integration with Existing Component Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-key-files]
- **Dashboard Integration**: `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` will use SSE for real-time updates
- **Ward Context**: `src/contexts/WardContext.jsx` - SSE events may trigger ward-specific updates
- **API Service**: `src/services/api.js` - SSE should complement, not replace, existing API communication
- **Error Boundaries**: Leverage existing `src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx` for SSE component protection

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- **Coverage Requirements**: Frontend minimum 70% component test coverage
- **Test Organization**: Tests adjacent to components with `.test.jsx` suffix
- **Testing Framework**: React Testing Library + Jest for SSE hook and service testing
- **Integration Testing**: SSE functionality must not break existing API endpoint tests

### Security Considerations
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]
- **Session-based Auth**: SSE connections must maintain existing secure session cookies
- **CORS Compliance**: SSE must work within existing CORS policies
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all SSE event data before processing
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect existing rate limiting for SSE connections
