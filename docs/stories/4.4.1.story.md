# Story 4.4.1: Bundle Optimization - Component Lazy Loading and Code Splitting

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** campaign team member accessing LokDarpan on various network conditions and devices,
**I want** optimized application loading with intelligent component lazy loading and code splitting,
**so that** the dashboard loads quickly even on slow networks and provides immediate access to critical political intelligence without waiting for non-essential features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Component Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for non-critical components (SentimentHeatmap, StrategicTimeline, advanced analytics) with loading states and error boundaries
2. **Route-based Code Splitting**: Split application bundles by route and feature areas with dynamic imports and progressive loading
3. **Critical Path Optimization**: Prioritize loading of essential components (Dashboard, LocationMap, AlertsPanel) while deferring advanced visualization components
4. **Progressive Loading Strategy**: Load core political intelligence first, then progressively enhance with advanced analytics and visualization features
5. **Bundle Size Reduction**: Achieve < 300KB initial bundle size with < 100KB critical path bundle for faster Time to Interactive (TTI)
6. **Network-aware Loading**: Adapt loading strategy based on connection quality with reduced feature sets for slow networks
7. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement bundle size monitoring and performance metrics tracking for optimization feedback

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Phase 4.3 Advanced Data Visualization: Created comprehensive visualization components (SentimentHeatmap, Enhanced LocationMap, StrategicTimeline) that are ideal candidates for lazy loading. These advanced components should load progressively after core political intelligence is available.

From Phase 4.2 Mobile SSE Optimization: Network quality detection and adaptive strategies provide perfect foundation for network-aware loading decisions and connection-based performance optimization.

### Bundle Analysis Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-stack]
- **Vite Build System**: Modern bundler with built-in code splitting, tree shaking, and dynamic imports
- **React 18**: Concurrent features and Suspense boundaries for optimal lazy loading experience
- **Bundle Dependencies**: Large libraries (Leaflet, Recharts, D3.js) ideal for code splitting optimization
- **Build Configuration**: `vite.config.js` customization for chunk splitting and optimization strategies

### Current Bundle Composition Analysis
[Source: frontend package.json dependencies]
**Large Dependencies Identified**:
- **Leaflet + React-Leaflet**: ~200KB for geographic visualization - defer until LocationMap needed
- **Recharts**: ~150KB for chart components - lazy load with analytics components
- **D3.js**: ~100KB for advanced visualizations - load with SentimentHeatmap and Timeline
- **React Query**: ~50KB for state management - critical path, keep in main bundle

### Critical Path Component Definition
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-key-files]
**Critical Path (Priority 1)**:
- `src/App.jsx` - Root application component with routing and context providers
- `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` - Main dashboard container and layout management
- `src/contexts/WardContext.jsx` - Global ward selection state management
- `src/services/api.js` - Core API client for authentication and basic data fetching

**High Priority (Priority 2)**:
- `src/components/AlertsPanel.jsx` - Essential political intelligence alerts
- `src/components/StrategicSummary.jsx` - Core political briefings and recommendations
- `src/components/ui/` - Basic UI components (Button, Card, LoadingSpinner)

**Progressive Loading (Priority 3)**:
- `src/components/LocationMap.jsx` - Geographic visualization (after Leaflet loads)
- `src/components/TimeSeriesChart.jsx` - Historical analytics (after Recharts loads)
- Advanced visualization components from Phase 4.3

### Code Splitting Strategy
[Source: Vite configuration patterns]
```javascript
// vite.config.js optimization strategy
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
          maps: ['leaflet', 'react-leaflet'],
          charts: ['recharts', 'd3'],
          analytics: ['./src/features/analytics']
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### React Lazy Loading Implementation Pattern
[Source: React 18 best practices]
```javascript
// Lazy loading pattern for visualization components
const SentimentHeatmap = lazy(() => import('./features/analytics/components/SentimentHeatmap.jsx'));
const StrategicTimeline = lazy(() => import('./features/analytics/components/StrategicTimeline.jsx'));

// Suspense boundary with loading states
<Suspense fallback={<ChartSkeleton />}>
  <SentimentHeatmap ward={selectedWard} />
</Suspense>
```

### Network-aware Loading Strategy
[Source: Phase 4.2 Mobile SSE Network Detection]
**Connection-based Loading Logic**:
- **WiFi/4G**: Load all components progressively with full feature set
- **3G**: Defer non-essential visualizations, load core intelligence first
- **2G/Slow**: Essential components only, advanced features on-demand
- **Offline**: Cached critical components with offline-capable political intelligence

### Performance Budget Targets
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]
**Bundle Size Targets**:
- **Initial Bundle**: < 300KB (down from current ~800KB estimated)
- **Critical Path**: < 100KB for sub-2s Time to Interactive on 3G
- **Component Chunks**: < 50KB per lazy-loaded visualization component
- **Vendor Chunks**: < 200KB for React, utilities, and core libraries

**Performance Metrics**:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.5s on 3G networks
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s for dashboard availability
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: < 3.5s for core political intelligence access
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1 for stable dashboard experience

### Error Handling for Dynamic Imports
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#error-handling]
**Chunk Loading Failures**:
- **Network Errors**: Retry with exponential backoff, fallback to cached versions
- **Parse Errors**: Graceful degradation with component-specific error boundaries
- **Module Failures**: Show loading fallback with manual retry options
- **Cache Issues**: Clear module cache and reload with user notification

### Integration with Existing Architecture
[Source: Phase 4.1 Component Error Boundaries]
- **Error Boundaries**: Wrap lazy-loaded components in existing ComponentErrorBoundary system
- **Loading States**: Use established loading skeleton components for consistent UX
- **Ward Context**: Ensure lazy components integrate with global ward selection state
- **SSE Integration**: Lazy components connect to real-time streaming after loading

### Performance Monitoring Implementation
**Core Web Vitals Tracking**:
```javascript
// Performance monitoring integration
import { getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB } from 'web-vitals';

// Report to performance monitoring service
function sendToAnalytics(metric) {
  // Integration with campaign performance dashboard
  console.log('Performance metric:', metric);
}

getCLS(sendToAnalytics);
getFID(sendToAnalytics);
getFCP(sendToAnalytics);
getLCP(sendToAnalytics);
getTTFB(sendToAnalytics);
```

### Testing Strategy for Performance Optimization
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
**Performance Testing Requirements**:
- **Bundle Size Testing**: Automated bundle size regression testing with CI/CD integration
- **Loading Sequence Testing**: Validate progressive loading order and component availability timing
- **Network Simulation Testing**: Test loading behavior across different connection speeds
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Chunk loading failures, network interruptions, cache corruption

### Campaign Team Impact Considerations
[Source: CLAUDE.md - Campaign Team UX]
**Field Operations Optimization**:
- **Mobile Field Access**: Faster initial loading for field coordinators on mobile networks
- **Low-bandwidth Operations**: Essential political intelligence available even on poor connections
- **Offline Resilience**: Critical components cached for offline campaign monitoring
- **Battery Optimization**: Reduced initial resource usage extending mobile device battery life
