# Story 4.3.2: Enhanced LocationMap - Real-time Data Overlays and Improved Ward Selection

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** campaign field coordinator monitoring real-time political developments across wards,
**I want** an enhanced interactive map with real-time data overlays and improved ward selection capabilities,
**so that** I can quickly visualize live political intelligence, identify emerging hotspots, and coordinate targeted campaign responses across the geographical landscape.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Real-time Data Overlays**: Display live sentiment scores, political activity levels, and alert indicators as colored overlays on ward boundaries with automatic refresh
2. **Multi-metric Visualization Layers**: Toggle between different data layers (sentiment, party mentions, alert density, demographic indicators) with smooth transitions
3. **Enhanced Ward Selection UX**: Improved click/touch interactions with hover previews, selection highlighting, and multi-ward selection capabilities
4. **Mobile Touch Optimization**: Responsive touch-friendly interactions with gesture support (pinch-to-zoom, pan) and optimized mobile layout
5. **Integration with SSE Streaming**: Real-time map updates via SSE for live political intelligence without manual refresh
6. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering for 150+ wards with viewport culling and progressive loading techniques
7. **Error Boundary Integration**: Robust error handling ensuring map failures don't crash dashboard with graceful fallback UI

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Phase 4.1 Component Isolation: LocationMap.jsx is successfully wrapped in ComponentErrorBoundary with comprehensive fallback UI. The error boundary infrastructure provides perfect foundation for enhanced map features without risking dashboard stability.

From Phase 4.2 Mobile SSE Optimization: Mobile-optimized SSE client with adaptive streaming and network awareness is operational. This provides the ideal foundation for real-time map updates with battery and bandwidth optimization.

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#data-visualization]
- **Leaflet**: Interactive mapping library already integrated - primary technology for geographic visualization
- **React-Leaflet**: React bindings established in existing LocationMap.jsx component
- **GeoJSON Processing**: Ward boundary data already integrated from backend geojson endpoints
- **Responsive Design**: TailwindCSS responsive patterns for mobile-first map layouts

### Existing Component Analysis
[Source: frontend/src/components/LocationMap.jsx - existing implementation]
- **Current Features**: Basic ward boundary display, click selection, ward normalization, error fallback
- **Enhancement Points**: Real-time overlays, multi-layer visualization, improved mobile interactions
- **Integration**: Already connected to WardContext for global ward selection state management
- **Error Handling**: ComponentErrorBoundary wrapper with fallback UI already implemented

### API Integration Requirements
[Source: CLAUDE.md - Key API Endpoints]
- **GeoJSON Data**: `/api/v1/geojson` provides ward boundary polygons for geographic overlay rendering
- **Real-time Trends**: `/api/v1/trends?ward={ward}&days={days}` for sentiment overlay data
- **Ward Metadata**: `/api/v1/ward/meta/{ward_id}` for demographic and profile overlays
- **SSE Streaming**: Backend SSE endpoints provide real-time political intelligence updates for live map overlays

### Data Models and Geographic Integration
[Source: CLAUDE.md - Ward Data Handling]
- **Ward Normalization**: Consistent "Ward 95 Jubilee Hills" â†’ "Jubilee Hills" pattern across frontend/backend
- **Geographic Linking**: Ward IDs link polling stations to results, demographics for comprehensive overlays
- **GeoJSON Format**: Standard ward boundary polygons with metadata properties for overlay rendering
- **Coordinate System**: Geographic projections compatible with Leaflet mapping system

### Mobile Optimization Requirements
[Source: Phase 4.2 Mobile SSE Implementation - Device Detection]
- **Touch Interactions**: Optimized for mobile field coordinators using dashboard on tablets/phones
- **Gesture Support**: Pinch-to-zoom, pan, tap-hold for mobile political intelligence gathering
- **Battery Awareness**: Integrate with mobile SSE battery optimization for extended field usage
- **Network Adaptation**: Adapt map data loading based on network quality for reliable field operations

### Performance Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]
- **Map Rendering**: < 2s initial map load with 150+ ward boundaries
- **Real-time Updates**: < 500ms overlay update latency for streaming political intelligence
- **Mobile Performance**: Efficient rendering on low-end devices used by field coordinators
- **Memory Management**: Prevent memory leaks during extended campaign monitoring sessions

### Integration with Existing Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-key-files]
- **Ward Context**: `src/contexts/WardContext.jsx` - enhanced map should update and respond to global ward selection
- **Dashboard Integration**: `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` - map enhancements integrate with existing dashboard layout
- **Error Boundaries**: Leverage existing `src/components/ComponentErrorBoundary.jsx` for enhanced resilience
- **API Service**: Use established `src/services/api.js` patterns for real-time data fetching

### Real-time Data Layer Specifications
[Source: frontend/src/components/TimeSeriesChart.jsx#EMOTIONS]
- **Sentiment Layers**: 7-emotion overlay system using established color palette (Positive: "#16a34a", Anger: "#ef4444", etc.)
- **Party Activity**: Multi-party mention density overlays for competitive analysis visualization
- **Alert Indicators**: Real-time alert density visualization for emerging political hotspot identification
- **Activity Levels**: Overall political activity intensity overlays for campaign resource allocation

### Error Handling and Fallback Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#error-handling]
- **Graceful Degradation**: Geographic data loading failures show ward list fallback without dashboard crash
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core map functionality preserved even when advanced overlays fail
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages for network issues, geographic data problems, or rendering failures
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for temporary geographic data service issues

### Mobile Field Coordinator Use Cases
[Source: CLAUDE.md - Campaign Team UX]
- **Field Monitoring**: Real-time sentiment monitoring during campaign events and public appearances
- **Rapid Response**: Quick identification of emerging political hotspots requiring immediate attention
- **Resource Coordination**: Visual resource allocation based on ward-level political activity and sentiment patterns
- **Multi-Ward Operations**: Simultaneous monitoring of multiple wards during coordinated campaign activities

### Testing and Validation Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- **Geographic Data Testing**: Validate GeoJSON processing, coordinate transformations, boundary rendering accuracy
- **Real-time Integration Testing**: SSE streaming integration with map overlays and update efficiency
- **Mobile Device Testing**: Touch interactions, gesture handling, responsive layout across device sizes
- **Performance Testing**: Large dataset rendering, real-time update handling, memory usage during extended sessions
