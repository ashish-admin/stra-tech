Draft

## Story
**As a** campaign strategist navigating between different wards and political intelligence data,
**I want** optimized state management with intelligent data prefetching and enhanced caching strategies,
**so that** ward transitions are instant, political data is always available when needed, and the dashboard provides seamless user experience without loading delays during critical campaign operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Enhanced React Query Configuration**: Optimize query client settings for political intelligence data patterns with intelligent cache management and stale-while-revalidate strategies
2. **Intelligent Ward Prefetching**: Predictive prefetching of likely ward selections based on user patterns, geographic proximity, and political activity levels
3. **Strategic Data Preloading**: Preload critical political intelligence (alerts, sentiment trends, strategic briefings) for active campaign areas
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Implement optimistic UI updates for user actions with rollback mechanisms for failed operations
5. **Cache Invalidation Strategy**: Smart cache invalidation based on data freshness requirements and real-time political developments
6. **Background Data Refresh**: Intelligent background refresh of political data with priority queuing and network-aware scheduling

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Phase 4.2 Mobile SSE Optimization: Network quality detection and adaptive strategies provide perfect foundation for intelligent background refresh and network-aware state management optimization.

From Phase 4.1 Error Boundaries: Component isolation ensures query failures in one area don't affect others, providing stable foundation for optimistic updates and error handling.

### Current React Query Implementation Analysis
[Source: frontend/src/services/api.js - existing patterns]
- **Query Client**: Basic configuration with default cache times and retry strategies
- **Ward Queries**: Simple useQuery patterns for trends, pulse, and ward metadata
- **Cache Management**: Limited cache invalidation and no prefetching strategies
- **Error Handling**: Basic error states without optimistic updates or rollback mechanisms

### Enhanced React Query Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#state-management]
```javascript
// Optimized Query Client Configuration
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes for political data
      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes cache retention
      retry: (failureCount, error) => {
        if (error.status === 404) return false;
        return failureCount < 3;
      },
      refetchOnWindowFocus: true, // Critical for campaign monitoring
      refetchOnReconnect: true, // Essential for field operations
    },
    mutations: {
      retry: 1,
      onError: (error) => {
        // Rollback optimistic updates
        console.error('Mutation failed:', error);
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Intelligent Prefetching Strategy
**Ward Prefetching Logic**:
- **Geographic Proximity**: Preload adjacent wards based on GeoJSON boundary data
- **User Patterns**: Track frequently accessed ward combinations and navigation flows
- **Political Activity**: Priority prefetch for wards with high alert activity or sentiment changes
- **Campaign Focus**: Preload data for wards marked as strategic priorities in campaign planning

**Data Prefetching Priorities**:
1. **Critical Intelligence** (Immediate): Active ward alerts, recent sentiment trends
2. **Strategic Context** (5s delay): Ward briefings, competitive analysis data  
3. **Historical Analytics** (10s delay): Long-term trends, demographic overlays
4. **Advanced Visualizations** (On-demand): Complex charts and heatmap data

### Optimistic Update Implementation
[Source: React Query optimistic updates patterns]
```javascript
// Optimistic Ward Selection
const useOptimisticWardSelection = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: selectWard,
    onMutate: async (newWard) => {
      // Cancel outgoing refetches
      await queryClient.cancelQueries(['ward', currentWard]);
      
      // Snapshot previous value
      const previousWard = queryClient.getQueryData(['ward', currentWard]);
      
      // Optimistically update UI
      queryClient.setQueryData(['ward', newWard], (old) => ({
        ...old,
        loading: true,
        optimistic: true
      }));
      
      return { previousWard };
    },
    onError: (err, newWard, context) => {
      // Rollback on error
      queryClient.setQueryData(['ward', currentWard], context.previousWard);
    },
    onSettled: () => {
      // Refetch regardless of success/error
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['ward']);
    }
  });
};
```

### Cache Invalidation and Freshness Strategy
**Data Freshness Requirements**:
- **Real-time Data** (30s max age): Alerts, live sentiment scores, active political events
- **Frequent Updates** (5m max age): Trend summaries, competitive analysis, strategic briefings  
- **Stable Data** (1h max age): Demographics, ward metadata, historical aggregates
- **Static Data** (24h max age): Geographic boundaries, author information, system configuration

**SSE-triggered Invalidation**:
- **Alert Updates**: Invalidate alert queries and related ward summaries
- **Sentiment Changes**: Invalidate trend queries and heatmap data
- **Strategic Analysis**: Invalidate briefing and recommendation queries
- **System Updates**: Invalidate configuration and metadata queries

### Background Refresh and Network Adaptation
[Source: Phase 4.2 Mobile SSE Network Quality Detection]
**Network-aware Refresh Strategy**:
- **WiFi/4G**: Full background refresh with 30s intervals for critical data
- **3G**: Reduced refresh frequency (2m intervals) with priority queuing  
- **2G/Slow**: Essential updates only (5m intervals) with user-initiated refresh
- **Offline**: Pause background refresh, rely on cached data with offline indicators

**Priority Queue System**:
1. **P0 - Critical**: Active alerts, emergency political developments
2. **P1 - High**: Current ward data, recent sentiment changes
3. **P2 - Medium**: Neighboring ward data, historical trends
4. **P3 - Low**: Demographic data, system metadata

### Memory Management and Cache Optimization
**Cache Size Management**:
- **Memory Monitoring**: Track total cache size and query result memory usage
- **LRU Eviction**: Remove least recently used ward data when memory limits approached
- **Cache Limits**: Max 50MB cache size, max 100 cached queries for extended campaign sessions
- **Cleanup Policies**: Remove queries older than 1 hour for inactive wards

**Memory-Efficient Patterns**:
```javascript
// Pagination for large datasets
const useInfiniteWardHistory = (wardId) => {
  return useInfiniteQuery({
    queryKey: ['wardHistory', wardId],
    queryFn: ({ pageParam = 0 }) => fetchWardHistory(wardId, pageParam),
    getNextPageParam: (lastPage) => lastPage.nextCursor,
    cacheTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    staleTime: 2 * 60 * 1000,  // 2 minutes
  });
};
```

### Integration with Existing Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-key-files]
- **Ward Context**: Enhanced prefetching integrates with `src/contexts/WardContext.jsx` for seamless transitions
- **API Service**: Optimized query client in `src/services/api.js` with intelligent caching strategies
- **SSE Integration**: Background refresh coordinates with mobile SSE client for conflict-free updates
- **Component Integration**: All existing components benefit from optimized caching without code changes

### Performance Monitoring and Metrics
**Query Performance Metrics**:
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Target >80% cache hits for frequently accessed political data
- **Query Response Time**: <200ms for cached queries, <1s for fresh political intelligence
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB total cache size during extended campaign monitoring
- **Prefetch Accuracy**: >70% of prefetched data actually used within 10 minutes

**User Experience Metrics**:
- **Ward Transition Speed**: <100ms for cached ward switches
- **Data Availability**: >95% immediate data availability for active campaign areas
- **Background Efficiency**: Minimal impact on foreground operations during background refresh
- **Error Recovery**: <2s recovery time from failed optimistic updates

### Campaign Operations Impact
