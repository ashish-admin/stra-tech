# Story 4.1.1: Core Error Boundary Infrastructure - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **political campaign strategist**,
I want **robust error handling that prevents single component failures from crashing my political intelligence dashboard**,
So that **I maintain access to critical campaign data even when individual components encounter errors**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: React component hierarchy, existing ErrorBoundary.jsx, Dashboard.jsx container, all chart and map components
- Technology: React 18 error boundary pattern, component lifecycle management, error state handling
- Follows pattern: Existing React component architecture with proper error boundary implementation
- Touch points: Component rendering, error detection, fallback UI rendering, error reporting

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **ComponentErrorBoundary Implementation**: Reusable error boundary component that catches JavaScript errors in child component tree, prevents error propagation, and displays graceful fallback UI
2. **Error Context and Reporting**: Centralized error context that tracks component errors, provides error details for debugging, and reports error patterns for monitoring
3. **Retry Mechanisms**: Error boundaries provide retry capability for failed components with exponential backoff and user-initiated retry options

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing React components continue to work unchanged with error boundary protection transparent during normal operation
5. New error boundary follows existing React component patterns and integrates seamlessly with current component hierarchy
6. Integration with Dashboard.jsx maintains current component rendering while adding error protection layer

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Error boundaries catch 100% of component JavaScript errors without affecting other components
8. Fallback UI provides clear error information and recovery options for users
9. Error reporting captures sufficient detail for debugging without exposing sensitive information

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create reusable ComponentErrorBoundary component, implement error context with React Context API, add retry mechanisms with component state management
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Enhance existing ErrorBoundary.jsx pattern with more comprehensive error handling and reporting
- **Key Constraints**: Must not interfere with normal component rendering, error boundaries only activate during actual error conditions

## Definition of Done

- [ ] ComponentErrorBoundary implemented with comprehensive error catching
- [ ] Error context operational with proper error state management
- [ ] Retry mechanisms tested with various component failure scenarios
- [ ] Integration requirements verified through comprehensive testing
- [ ] Existing component functionality regression tested
- [ ] Fallback UI provides clear error communication and recovery options
- [ ] Error reporting captures appropriate detail for debugging
- [ ] Documentation updated for error boundary usage patterns

## Status
**DRAFT** - Implementation incomplete. Error context and retry mechanisms missing.

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Error boundaries could interfere with normal React component lifecycle or state management
- **Mitigation**: Follow React error boundary best practices, only activate during actual errors, comprehensive testing of normal component operation
- **Rollback**: Remove error boundary wrappers to revert to current component rendering, no state or data changes required

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing component props or interfaces
- [x] Error boundaries are transparent during normal operation
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (only during error conditions)
- [x] React component patterns maintained and enhanced

## Effort Estimation

**Story Points**: 5  
**Technical Complexity**: Medium  
**Integration Risk**: Low  
**Estimated Duration**: 4-5 hours focused development
