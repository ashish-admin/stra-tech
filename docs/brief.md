# Project Brief: LokDarpan Political Intelligence Dashboard

## Executive Summary

LokDarpan is a high-stakes, AI-driven political intelligence dashboard designed to provide real-time, 360-degree political landscape insights for campaign teams in Hyderabad, India. The platform leverages a sophisticated multi-model AI architecture combining Google Gemini 2.5 Pro and Perplexity AI to deliver actionable strategic intelligence that moves beyond simple monitoring to provide decisive competitive advantages for electoral campaigns.

**Current Status:** Phase 3 (Automated Strategic Response) implementation with established Flask + PostgreSQL + Redis + Celery backend and React + Vite frontend, serving ward-centric electoral data and real-time news analysis.

## Problem Statement

Political campaigns in India face critical intelligence gaps that limit their strategic effectiveness:

- **Fragmented Information Sources:** Campaign teams struggle to aggregate and analyze political sentiment across multiple news sources, social media platforms, and electoral data in real-time
- **Reactive Decision Making:** Most campaigns operate reactively, responding to developments after they've already impacted public sentiment rather than anticipating and preparing for emerging issues
- **Limited Strategic Intelligence:** Existing tools provide basic monitoring but lack sophisticated analysis of political sentiment, competitive positioning, and predictive insights necessary for strategic advantage
- **Geographic Complexity:** Ward-level political dynamics in major cities like Hyderabad require granular analysis that traditional tools cannot provide
- **Time-Critical Nature:** Political landscapes change rapidly during campaign periods, requiring immediate access to actionable intelligence

The impact is significant: campaigns lose competitive advantages, miss strategic opportunities, and make suboptimal resource allocation decisions due to information asymmetries.

## Proposed Solution

LokDarpan provides a comprehensive political intelligence platform that transforms raw political data into strategic competitive advantages through:

**Core Differentiators:**
- **Multi-Model AI Architecture:** Combines Google Gemini 2.5 Pro and Perplexity AI for sophisticated political context analysis and strategic reasoning
- **Ward-Centric Intelligence:** Granular analysis at the electoral ward level, enabling precise targeting and resource allocation
- **Real-Time Strategic Analysis:** SSE streaming for live political developments with immediate strategic impact assessment
- **Proactive Alert System:** AI-powered early warning system for emerging political issues and opportunities
- **Comprehensive Electoral Integration:** Deep integration with electoral data, demographics, and historical voting patterns

**Why This Solution Succeeds:**
- Built specifically for Indian political context with cultural and linguistic awareness
- Combines multiple AI models for enhanced accuracy and perspective diversity
- Real-time processing enables proactive rather than reactive campaign strategies
- Ward-level granularity provides actionable insights for ground-level campaign operations
