## Quality Gate Execution

### Automated Gates (CI/CD Pipeline)

```bash
# Backend quality gates
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=strategist --cov-fail-under=80
python -m flake8 strategist/
python -m mypy strategist/
python -m bandit -r strategist/

# Frontend quality gates  
cd frontend
npm run test:coverage
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run build

# E2E gates
npx playwright test --reporter=list
```

### Manual Gates (Pre-deployment)

1. **Security Review**
   - Manual penetration testing
   - Code review for security vulnerabilities
   - Compliance audit with electoral guidelines
   - AI output review for bias and appropriateness

2. **Performance Review**
   - Load testing with realistic data volumes
   - Stress testing under peak usage
   - Memory leak testing for long-running processes
   - Database performance optimization

3. **Business Logic Review**
   - AI output quality assessment
   - Strategic recommendations accuracy
   - Source credibility validation
   - Electoral compliance verification

## Gate Failure Handling

### Critical Failures (Block Deployment)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypass
- Data integrity issues
- AI safety violations
- Performance below minimum thresholds

### Warning Failures (Review Required)
- Test coverage below target
- Performance degradation
- Minor compliance issues
- Documentation gaps

### Remediation Process

1. **Immediate**: Fix critical security and safety issues
2. **Short-term**: Address performance and reliability issues  
3. **Long-term**: Improve test coverage and documentation
4. **Continuous**: Monitor and optimize system performance

## Compliance Requirements

### Electoral Guidelines
- All AI outputs marked as internal use only
- No misinformation generation or amplification
- Proper attribution of information sources
- Audit trails for all strategic recommendations

### Technical Standards
- OWASP security guidelines
- GDPR/privacy compliance for data handling
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance budgets maintained

### Operational Standards
- 99.5% uptime during campaign periods
- <3 second response times for user interactions
- 24/7 monitoring and alerting
- Incident response procedures

## Continuous Quality Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Quality**: Test coverage, code quality scores, AI accuracy
- **Security**: Vulnerability counts, failed authentication attempts
- **Business**: User satisfaction, feature adoption, strategic impact

### Review Schedule
- **Daily**: Automated test results and performance metrics
- **Weekly**: Security scan results and compliance status
- **Monthly**: Quality metrics review and improvement planning
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive system audit and optimization
