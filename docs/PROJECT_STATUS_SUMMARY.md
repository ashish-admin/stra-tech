## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FINDINGS & CORRECTIONS**

### **Previous Planning Errors Identified**:
1. **Sprint Capacity Overestimation**: Claimed 40 SP capacity based on incomplete validation
2. **Phase Completion Claims**: Frontend reorganization benefits not yet validated with comprehensive testing  
3. **Resource Allocation Miscalculation**: Story point equivalency between different work types incorrectly assumed
4. **Infrastructure Assumptions**: Political Strategist readiness significantly overestimated

### **Corrective Actions Taken**:
1. ‚úÖ Reset sprint capacity to proven 20 SP baseline
2. ‚úÖ Initiated comprehensive QA validation of frontend reorganization  
3. ‚úÖ Identified and documented all Political Strategist blocking issues
4. ‚úÖ Created realistic Infrastructure Foundation Sprint plan
5. ‚úÖ Assigned specialized technical leads for infrastructure and validation
