- Strategic context mode selector (defensive|neutral|offensive)

### UI Consistency Requirements

**Error State Consistency**: Error boundaries must display user-friendly messages using the same alert/notification styling as your existing AlertsPanel component, maintaining visual harmony with your political intelligence theme.

**Loading State Harmony**: SSE progress indicators must align with your existing loading patterns in TimeSeriesChart and other data visualization components, using consistent spinner/progress bar styling.

**Responsive Behavior**: All new components must maintain your mobile-first responsive design, ensuring error boundaries and real-time features work seamlessly across device sizes during field campaign operations.

**Accessibility Preservation**: New components must maintain keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility consistent with your current accessibility implementation level.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python (Flask backend), JavaScript (React frontend), SQL (PostgreSQL)

**Frameworks**: 
- Backend: Flask + SQLAlchemy + Alembic + Flask-Login + Celery + CORS
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite 7 + TailwindCSS + React Query + Leaflet

**Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching for performance optimization

**Infrastructure**: Development environment with potential cloud deployment, Celery for background processing

**External Dependencies**:

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Add new tables for Political Strategist analysis results, SSE connection tracking, and error logging while preserving existing electoral data schema. Use foreign key relationships to link strategic analysis with ward-based intelligence.

**API Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Flask blueprint structure with new `/api/v1/strategist` endpoints for SSE streaming. Maintain current session-based authentication while adding connection management for real-time features.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Implement error boundaries as Higher-Order Components wrapping existing components. Add SSE client service following your React Query patterns for state management and caching.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing testing approach (if any) to include error boundary testing, SSE connection testing, and Political Strategist integration testing using your current testing framework.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
- Backend: Extend existing `app/strategist/` module with SSE router and enhanced service components
- Frontend: Add `src/components/error-boundaries/` and `src/services/sse/` following your current modular organization
- Maintain existing `frontend/src/components/` and `backend/app/` separation

**Naming Conventions**: Follow your established patterns (camelCase for frontend, snake_case for backend) with descriptive component names like `ComponentErrorBoundary`, `SSEClient`, `StrategistStream`.

**Coding Standards**: Adhere to your documented improvement roadmap including ESLint/Prettier for frontend and flake8/black for backend when implemented.

**Documentation Standards**: Update CLAUDE.md with new component documentation following your existing comprehensive format, including troubleshooting guides for SSE and error boundary features.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Enhance existing Vite build process to handle new error boundary components and SSE client code without breaking current `npm run build` workflow.

**Deployment Strategy**: Maintain current development server approach (`flask run` + `npm run dev`) while adding SSE endpoint configuration and error boundary testing procedures.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing logging patterns to include error boundary activation tracking, SSE connection metrics, and Political Strategist analysis performance monitoring.

**Configuration Management**: Add SSE configuration options to existing environment setup while preserving current `.env` file structure for API keys and database connections.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- Error boundary implementation could introduce performance overhead in React rendering
- SSE connections may overwhelm backend during high campaign period usage  
- Multi-model AI integration complexity could destabilize existing analysis capabilities

**Integration Risks**:
- Component wrapping with error boundaries might interfere with existing React Query data flow
- SSE streaming could conflict with existing API caching strategies
- Political Strategist enhancements might impact current ward-based intelligence performance

**Deployment Risks**:
- Development environment complexity increase with SSE server management
- Real-time features require careful testing under campaign period load conditions

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement error boundaries incrementally, testing each component wrapper individually
- Add SSE connection pooling and rate limiting to prevent backend overwhelm
- Maintain fallback to existing analysis methods if Political Strategist becomes unavailable
- Comprehensive testing of error scenarios before campaign period deployment

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: **Single comprehensive epic** with rationale based on actual project analysis.

**Rationale**: Based on my analysis of your existing LokDarpan architecture, this enhancement should be structured as a single comprehensive epic because:

1. **Architectural Cohesion**: Error boundaries, SSE integration, and Political Strategist completion are tightly coupled - they all serve the goal of campaign-period reliability and real-time intelligence
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: All enhancements leverage your existing Flask/React foundation and require coordinated testing to ensure system integrity
3. **Sequential Dependencies**: Component resilience must be established before reliable real-time features, and Political Strategist completion benefits from the enhanced error handling
4. **Campaign Timeline**: Your 6-month window for electoral impact requires coordinated delivery rather than fragmented feature releases

## Epic 1: LokDarpan Campaign-Ready Resilience & Real-Time Intelligence

**Epic Goal**: Transform LokDarpan into a campaign-period reliable political intelligence platform with component-level resilience, real-time strategic analysis capabilities, and enhanced Political Strategist system that maintains 99.5% availability during critical electoral periods.
