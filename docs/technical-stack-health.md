   - Solution: Complete `strategist/router.py` SSE implementation
   - Timeline: 2-3 days

2. **Error Boundary Coverage Gaps**
   - Impact: Component failures could cascade
   - Solution: Wrap critical components in error boundaries
   - Timeline: 1 day

3. **AI Service Rate Limiting**
   - Impact: Analysis delays during high usage
   - Solution: Implement intelligent caching and queuing
   - Timeline: 2 days

## Risk Analysis: Agile Team Perspectives

### **Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Action**

**üö® EXISTENTIAL BUSINESS RISKS (Product Owner Priority)**
1. **AI Service Dependency Failures**: Without AI analysis, LokDarpan becomes a basic news aggregator, losing core value proposition
2. **Campaign Season Load Spikes**: Election periods are revenue-generating moments; downtime = lost customers
3. **Political Data Security**: Breaches could end the business; upgrade from medium to HIGH priority
4. **AI Bias in Recommendations**: Biased analysis could destroy credibility with campaign teams

**‚ö° TECHNICAL FOUNDATION RISKS (Developer Priority)**
1. **WardContext Architecture Debt**: State corruption could affect entire dashboard; needs reducer pattern refactoring
2. **External API Integration Brittleness**: Contract testing and versioning essential for reliability
3. **SSE Memory Management**: Browser memory leaks with continuous streaming require proper cleanup

**üîç QUALITY ASSURANCE GAPS (QA Priority)**
1. **Zero Performance Testing**: No baselines established for scalability claims
2. **AI Validation Framework Missing**: No systematic way to test AI recommendation accuracy
3. **Security Testing Deficit**: Penetration testing needed before launch, not after

### **Team-Aligned Action Plan**

**IMMEDIATE (This Sprint - Week 1):**
- **Security Audit** (Business Critical): External penetration testing and OWASP compliance
- **WardContext Refactoring** (Technical Foundation): Implement reducer pattern with validation
