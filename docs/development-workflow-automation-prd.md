#### Background Context
LokDarpan has achieved 95% production readiness with sophisticated AI capabilities but needs structured development workflow automation to maintain quality while accelerating feature delivery for political campaigns. The system requires enterprise-grade development processes that can handle complex political intelligence features while maintaining the existing zero-cascade failure architecture. Integration of BMad methodology will provide structured approaches for brownfield enhancement while preserving the system's proven reliability and performance characteristics.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The system shall integrate BMad workflow methodology with existing LokDarpan development processes without disrupting current Phase 5 operational capabilities.

**FR2**: Automated story creation workflows shall generate development stories that align with existing LokDarpan component architecture and error boundary patterns.

**FR3**: The testing automation framework shall integrate with existing backend testing (Flask/Celery) and frontend testing (React/Vite) while maintaining current 95% production readiness standards.

**FR4**: Business analysis workflows shall automate PRD creation, epic management, and story validation using existing LokDarpan documentation patterns.

**FR5**: Documentation management automation shall maintain consistency with existing CLAUDE.md structure and project phase tracking.

**FR6**: Scrum automation workflows shall integrate with existing git workflow and development phases without disrupting current deployment processes.

**FR7**: The workflow system shall support both incremental development (single stories) and major enhancements (multiple epics) for political intelligence features.

**FR8**: Automated validation workflows shall enforce existing coding standards, API patterns, and component resilience requirements.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Workflow automation must maintain existing system performance characteristics and not impact current 95% production readiness standards.

**NFR2**: All automated processes must complete within acceptable timeframes: story creation <5 minutes, testing validation <10 minutes, documentation updates <3 minutes.

**NFR3**: The system must maintain compatibility with existing development tools (Visual Studio Code, git workflow, package managers).

**NFR4**: Automation workflows must be fault-tolerant and provide clear error handling without impacting ongoing development work.

**NFR5**: Memory usage for workflow automation must not exceed 10% additional overhead on development environment.

**NFR6**: All automated processes must maintain audit trails and logging consistent with existing system monitoring.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1: API Compatibility**: Workflow automation must work with existing Flask API patterns and not require changes to established endpoints like `/api/v1/trends`, `/api/v1/strategist/*`.

**CR2: Database Schema Compatibility**: Automation processes must work with existing PostgreSQL schema and not require modifications to core tables (User, Post, Epaper, etc.).

**CR3: UI/UX Consistency**: Any workflow-related UI components must follow existing React component patterns and error boundary architecture.

**CR4: Integration Compatibility**: Automation must work with existing AI service integrations (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Perplexity) and Celery background task architecture.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.x (backend), JavaScript ES6+ (frontend), SQL (PostgreSQL)
**Frameworks**: Flask (backend), React 18 (frontend), Vite 7 (build), Celery (background tasks)
**Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching layer
**Infrastructure**: Docker containerization, nginx proxy, local development with cloud deployment capability
**External Dependencies**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro API, Perplexity AI API, news APIs, geospatial libraries (Leaflet)

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Workflow metadata storage using existing PostgreSQL instance with separate schema namespace to avoid conflicts with political intelligence data.

**API Integration Strategy**: RESTful API endpoints following existing `/api/v1/workflow/*` pattern with authentication using current session-based system.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: React components following existing error boundary patterns with integration into Dashboard.jsx architecture.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Jest/React Testing Library for frontend, pytest for backend, maintaining existing test coverage standards.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing modular structure with workflow components in `backend/app/workflow/` and `frontend/src/workflow/` directories.

**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing camelCase (frontend) and snake_case (backend) patterns with workflow-specific prefixes.

**Coding Standards**: Adhere to existing Python formatting standards (backend) and ESLint configuration (frontend).

**Documentation Standards**: Update CLAUDE.md with workflow commands and maintain existing section structure.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Integrate with existing `npm run build` (frontend) and Flask application factory pattern (backend).

**Deployment Strategy**: Use existing development server setup with optional Docker integration for production workflow automation.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing logging patterns with workflow-specific log levels and audit trails.

**Configuration Management**: Use existing .env pattern with workflow-specific environment variables.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- Workflow automation complexity may conflict with existing AI service circuit breakers
- BMad integration patterns may not align perfectly with current React error boundaries

**Integration Risks**:
- Workflow database operations may impact existing political intelligence data operations
- New automation processes may interfere with current Celery task scheduling

**Deployment Risks**:
- Additional dependencies may complicate existing development server startup
- Workflow components may affect current frontend bundle optimization

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement workflow isolation using separate database schemas and API namespaces
- Use feature flags to enable/disable workflow automation without system impact
- Maintain rollback procedures for all workflow-related changes
- Extensive testing in development environment before any integration
