# 🚀 LOKDARPAN NEXT SPRINT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

**Generated**: August 23, 2025  
**Framework**: BMad Multi-Agent Analysis (analyst, po, pm, dev)  
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR EXECUTION**

---

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on comprehensive multi-agent analysis, LokDarpan requires immediate focus on **reliability enhancement** and **performance optimization** before proceeding with advanced features. Current system is **75% operational** with solid foundation but critical gaps in component isolation and test coverage.

### **Key Findings**:
- ✅ **System Operational**: Core political intelligence platform stable
- ⚠️ **Phase 3 Status**: 75% complete with 60/126 tests failing (47.6% failure rate)
- 🚨 **Critical Gap**: Component isolation not validated (cascade failure risk)
- ✅ **Foundation Ready**: Error boundary architecture implemented

### **Strategic Decision**: 
**Modified Phase 4 approach** - Focus on reliability (4.1) and performance (4.4) only. Defer advanced visualizations until Phase 3 AI strategist completion.
