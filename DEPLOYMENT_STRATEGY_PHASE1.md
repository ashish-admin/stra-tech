```

### Build Process Optimization

1. **Vite Build Configuration**
   - Code splitting optimized for political dashboard components
   - Bundle size limits: Main JS < 300KB, CSS < 50KB
   - Tree shaking for unused dependencies
   - Compression with Brotli + Gzip

2. **Asset Optimization**
   - Image optimization with WebP format
   - Font subsetting for Indian languages
   - Critical CSS inlining
   - Lazy loading for non-critical components

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Static assets: 1 year cache with versioning
   - Political data: 24-hour cache with revalidation
   - Strategic analysis: 10-minute cache
   - Service worker for offline capabilities

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Server Specifications (Minimum)
- **CPU**: 2 vCPUs (4 vCPUs recommended)
- **RAM**: 4GB (8GB recommended) 
- **Storage**: 50GB SSD (100GB recommended)
- **Bandwidth**: 100 Mbps (1 Gbps recommended)
- **Location**: Indian data centers (Mumbai/Bangalore)

### Container Specifications
- **Base Image**: `nginx:alpine` (minimal footprint)
- **Node Build**: `node:18-alpine` (build stage only)
- **Security**: Non-root user execution
- **Health Checks**: Built-in HTTP health endpoints

## Network Optimization Strategy

### Indian Network Conditions Support

#### 4G Networks (Primary Target)
- **Latency**: 50-200ms
- **Bandwidth**: 5-20 Mbps
- **Strategy**: Full feature experience with real-time updates
- **Optimizations**: HTTP/2 push, preloading critical resources

#### 3G Networks (Rural Areas)
- **Latency**: 100-500ms
- **Bandwidth**: 1-5 Mbps  
- **Strategy**: Progressive enhancement with reduced imagery
- **Optimizations**: Aggressive compression, lazy loading

#### 2G Fallback (Emergency Support)
- **Latency**: 300-1000ms
- **Bandwidth**: 56-256 Kbps
- **Strategy**: Text-only critical functionality
- **Optimizations**: Minimal JavaScript, server-side rendering

#### Offline Support (Campaign Field Teams)
- **Strategy**: PWA with service worker caching
- **Capabilities**: Cached political data, basic analysis tools
- **Sync**: Background sync when connectivity restored

## Security Configuration

### HTTPS and Certificate Management
```nginx
# SSL Configuration
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
ssl_stapling on;
```

### Security Headers
```nginx
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
```

### Content Security Policy
```nginx
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' ws: wss:;" always;
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance Metrics

| Network | Initial Load | Ward Switch | Chart Render | Memory Usage |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 4G WiFi | < 1.5s      | < 0.5s      | < 0.3s       | < 100MB      |
| 4G      | < 2.0s      | < 0.8s      | < 0.5s       | < 120MB      |
| 3G      | < 5.0s      | < 2.0s      | < 1.0s       | < 150MB      |
| 2G      | < 10s       | < 5.0s      | < 3.0s       | < 200MB      |

### Core Web Vitals Targets
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: < 3.8s

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Component Isolation Strategy
```javascript
// Three-tier error boundary system
1. Component-level: Individual feature isolation
2. Feature-level: Dashboard section isolation  
3. Application-level: Global error recovery
```

### Graceful Degradation
- **Map failures**: Ward dropdown remains functional
- **Chart failures**: Raw data tables available
- **API failures**: Cached data with offline indicators
- **Network failures**: Progressive retry with exponential backoff

## Monitoring and Health Checks

### Health Check Endpoints
```nginx
location /health {
    access_log off;
    add_header Content-Type text/plain;
    return 200 "healthy\n";
}

location /health/detailed {
    proxy_pass http://backend/api/v1/health;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Web Vitals collection
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Automated performance testing
- **Error Tracking**: Component-level error aggregation
- **Network Monitoring**: API response time tracking
