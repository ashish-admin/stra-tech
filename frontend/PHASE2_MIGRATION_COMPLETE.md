#### Performance Hooks
- ✅ **useEnhancedQuery**: Advanced React Query wrapper
- ✅ **useLazyLoading**: Intersection observer-based loading
- ✅ **useLazyComponent**: Dynamic component imports
- ✅ **Performance monitoring**: Bundle and render time tracking

### 🔧 Developer Experience

#### Enhanced Configuration
- ✅ **Path aliases**: `@features`, `@shared`, `@components`, `@hooks`
- ✅ **Import optimization**: Barrel exports and tree shaking
- ✅ **Development tools**: Performance monitoring and validation
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: Zero-breaking-change migration

#### Quality Assurance
- ✅ **Migration validation script**: 100% success rate
- ✅ **Error boundaries**: Component-level isolation
