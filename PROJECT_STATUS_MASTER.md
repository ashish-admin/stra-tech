# LokDarpan Project Status - Master Document
**Single Source of Truth for Project Completion Status**

**Date**: August 29, 2025  
**Documentation Steward**: Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)  
**Last Updated**: August 29, 2025 - Critical Analysis Complete  
**Overall System Status**: ⚠️ **75% PRODUCTION READY** - Backend Operational, Frontend Integration Issues  
**Critical Finding**: Phase 3-5 features implemented in code but NOT accessible via UI

---

## Executive Summary

LokDarpan has **strong technical infrastructure** with comprehensive backend implementation, but **critical integration issues prevent full utilization** of the $200K+ Phase 3-4 investment. While backend services are operational with 84 Political Strategist endpoints, the **frontend UI does not provide access** to these advanced capabilities.

**Current Deployment Status**: ⚠️ **LIMITED DEPLOYMENT READY** - Basic dashboard functional, but Political Strategist, Advanced Analytics, and Phase 3-5 features are **NOT accessible to campaign teams** through the UI.
