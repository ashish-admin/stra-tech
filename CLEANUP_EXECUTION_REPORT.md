#### Backend Configuration:
- **Removed redundant**: `backend/config/app_config.py` (backed up first)
- **Standardized on**: `backend/config.py` as primary configuration
- **Cleaned nested**: Removed empty `backend/config/` directory

#### Frontend Configuration:  
- **Removed duplicate**: `frontend/frontend/.env.local` (nested directory cleanup)
- **Maintained comprehensive**: `frontend/.env.example` (126 lines with telemetry config)
- **Eliminated redundancy**: Removed nested frontend directory structure

#### API Validation:
- ✅ Backend API responding: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/status`
- ✅ Authentication flow preserved  
- ✅ CORS configuration maintained

### ✅ PHASE 5: Database Documentation & Virtual Environment (P2-MEDIUM)
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Timeline**: 14:33-14:35 UTC (2 minutes)

#### Database Documentation:
